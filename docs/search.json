    "text": "Hello!\nWelcome, and thanks so much for reading! I’m Adam!\n\n\n\n\n\nI made this website for a few reasons:\n\nAs a piece for my data analytics portfolio\nAs an ode to baseball\nTo help fantasy baseball managers, if even a little!\n\nIt’s the final product of a yearlong endeavor to learn R and grow my skills in analytics.\nI hope you enjoy it and find something valuable here.\nI’d be happy to connect with you on LinkedIn, GitHub, and/or Twitter/X (specific to my baseball fandom). I’m still not exactly sure how to use those platforms, but I’m there. I set up an email as well: roster crunch @ gmail . com.\nFor a bit of personal bio, my wife and I currently live in Chicago and love spending days at the lakefront, exploring new places, thrifting CDs, drinking Sputnik coffee, etc… Outside of baseball, I love reading and playing chess when I can find the time.\nProfessionally, I work for a federal government agency—AmeriCorps—as an Associate Portfolio Manager. My background is primarily in the social and public sectors with a focus on capacity building (data analysis, research, project/volunteer/grants management, outreach) for organizations who support communities in fighting poverty. My current position is a term-appointment, such that I am actively looking for my next role. If you know of any opportunities or you’re looking for someone to join your team, feel free to reach out to me.\nThanks again!"

    "text": "3.1 Weighted On-Base Average (wOBA)\nBefore we get any further, we have to talk about Weighted On-Base Average (wOBA).\nThe sabermetric savants at FanGraphs explain wOBA, a creation of the master savant—Tom Tango—far more accurately and eloquently than I can. My key takeaways are that wOBA is a comprehensive offensive statistic which more accurately quantifies a batter’s performance than other more traditional statistics. Batting Average (BA), On-Base Percentage (OBP), Slugging Percentage (SLG), On-Base + Slugging Percentage (OPS), can’t capture the nuance of a batter’s value like wOBA does. This is because wOBA measures the precise effect (value) a walk, single, double, triple, home run, even hit-by-pitches (HBP) have on whether teams score a run or not and bakes that into the statistic.\n\n\n\nSource: FanGraphs\n\n\nFor our purposes, wOBA will serve as our catch-all statistic to measure player performance.\nThe main limitation for us is that wOBA is not directly equivalent with fantasy baseball value. The biggest reason is Stolen Bases are excluded, which count for a portion of a player’s value (or lack of value) in fantasy baseball leagues. The second reason is that wOBA does not explicitly include Runs or RBIs, two additional fantasy categories, even though we know players who are on base more will generally score more runs and have more RBIs than players who make more outs. We could likely find more limitations, but those are the biggest.\nHaving said that, a glance at the leaderboards most seasons, and elite hitters almost always have high wOBAs. Second, our analysis is primarily focused on correlation between initial and career performance in the big leagues, not necessarily the intrinsic values of either. wOBA will certainly suffice for our analysis!\nBecause wOBA is an offensive statistic, it should be used with some caution for pitchers. There are interesting discussions here and here that lend insight into why that is, which also are relevant to batters. For our purposes, wOBA-against or wOBA-allowed is also sufficient despite its shortcomings for the two aforementioned reasons. If I had more time, I may have calculated and used K-BB% (Stikeouts minus Walks Percentage) as the catch-all pitching statistic, but wOBA-against will do."

    "text": "3.2 Data Context\nSome important context to keep in mind as you navigate through the different visualizations:\n\nAll batters and starting pitchers who debuted from 1990 through 2010 are included\n\nNon-starting pitchers are not included\n\nStats are from the 1990 season through 2020\nIntentional walks and sacrifice bunts are by default excluded from wOBA, so Plate Appearances (PAs) and Batters Faced (BF) are only those that ended in a wOBA-producing event\nAn initial wOBA grade of “DNQ” stands for Did Not Qualify, meaning a player did not reach the stated Plate Appearances or Batters Faced thresholds\n\nFor example, a batter who only had 120 career plate appearances did not qualify for either the 150 or 600 PA thresholds\n\nThere is also a DNQ threshold set for the post wOBA grade\n\nCorresponding to the initial grade for 150 PAs, the post grade threshold is 600 PAs\nFor 600 PAs, 1800 PAs\nFor 215 BFs, 860 BFs\nFor 860 BFs, 2580 BFs\n\nPost wOBA grades of DNQ are counted as “Bad” post grades in the plots below\nThe Batters Faced threshold was chosen to equal roughly 50 Innings Pitched (215 BFs) and 200 Innings Pitched (860 BFs)\nProspect ranks are from Baseball America preseason Top 100 lists\n\nIf a prospect was on a top 100 list but fell off the list prior to their debut, they were not considered a top 100 prospect\nIf a prospect was not on a top 100 list when they debuted but were added before they lost prospect eligibility, they are included (confirm this)"

    "text": "3.4 Initial Observations\n\nNearly a third of batters did not even reach 150 PA and nearly half did not reach 600 PA.\nA batter who hit for a Good wOBA over their first 150 PA was more likely to have a Bad wOBA grade for the rest of their career than Good.\n\nRemember that a grade of “Did Not Qualify,” meaning in this case that they didn’t reach 600 PA, falls under a “Bad” grade. Both regression and attrition are contributing to this.\n\n\nWhile this is interesting at a macro-level, watch what happens when we look at groups of batters based on their prospect rank."

    "text": "3.6 Observations\nThe observations we made when looking at all batters remain true only when looking at certain groups of prospects, particularly unranked prospects. * For instance, a large percentage of the batters who did not qualify were unranked prospects.\nYou probably already sensed this, but a majority of batters are unranked prospects. They weight heavily in the graph with all batters, making it hard to see the effect of top ranked prospects.\nCan you any spot differences between the 150 PA and 600 PA graphs?\nPurely based on looking at them, especially for prospects ranked 1 through 75, the 600 PA graphs appear more orderly. Additionally, it looks like more batters are falling into the “Average” wOBA grade bucket. This speaks to larger sample sizes helping to reduce noise and volatility."

    "text": "4.1 Weighted On-Base Average (wOBA)\nBefore we get any further, we have to talk about Weighted On-Base Average (wOBA).\nThe sabermetric savants at FanGraphs explain wOBA, a creation of the master savant—Tom Tango—far more accurately and eloquently than I can. My key takeaways are that wOBA is a comprehensive offensive statistic which more accurately quantifies a batter’s performance than other more traditional statistics. Batting Average (BA), On-Base Percentage (OBP), Slugging Percentage (SLG), On-Base + Slugging Percentage (OPS), can’t capture the nuance of a batter’s value like wOBA does. This is because wOBA measures the precise effect (value) a walk, single, double, triple, home run, even hit-by-pitches (HBP) have on whether teams score a run or not and bakes that into the statistic.\n\n\n\nSource: FanGraphs\n\n\nFor our purposes, wOBA will serve as our catch-all statistic to measure player performance.\nThe main limitation for us is that wOBA is not directly equivalent with fantasy baseball value. The biggest reason is Stolen Bases are excluded, which count for a portion of a player’s value (or lack of value) in fantasy baseball leagues. The second reason is that wOBA does not explicitly include Runs or RBIs, two additional fantasy categories, even though we know players who are on base more will generally score more runs and have more RBIs than players who make more outs. We could likely find more limitations, but those are the biggest.\nHaving said that, a glance at the leaderboards most seasons, and elite hitters almost always have high wOBAs. Second, our analysis is primarily focused on correlation between initial and career performance in the big leagues, not necessarily the intrinsic values of either. wOBA will certainly suffice for our analysis!\nBecause wOBA is an offensive statistic, it should be used with some caution for pitchers. There are interesting discussions here and here that lend insight into why that is, which also are relevant to batters. For our purposes, wOBA-against or wOBA-allowed is also sufficient despite its shortcomings for the two aforementioned reasons. If I had more time, I may have calculated and used K-BB% (Stikeouts minus Walks Percentage) as the catch-all pitching statistic, but wOBA-against will do."

    "text": "4.4 Initial Observations\n\nNearly a third of batters did not even reach 150 PA and nearly half did not reach 600 PA.\nA batter who hit for a Good wOBA over their first 150 PA was more likely to have a Bad wOBA grade for the rest of their career than Good.\n\nRemember that a grade of “Did Not Qualify,” meaning in this case that they didn’t reach 600 PA, falls under a “Bad” grade. Both regression and attrition are contributing to this.\n\n\nWhile this is interesting at a macro-level, watch what happens when we look at groups of batters based on their prospect rank."

    "text": "4.6 Observations\nThe observations we made when looking at all batters remain true only when looking at certain groups of prospects, particularly unranked prospects. * For instance, a large percentage of the batters who did not qualify were unranked prospects.\nYou probably already sensed this, but a majority of batters are unranked prospects. They weight heavily in the graph with all batters, making it hard to see the effect of top ranked prospects.\nCan you any spot differences between the 150 PA and 600 PA graphs?\nPurely based on looking at them, especially for prospects ranked 1 through 75, the 600 PA graphs appear more orderly. Additionally, it looks like more batters are falling into the “Average” wOBA grade bucket. This speaks to larger sample sizes helping to reduce noise and volatility."

    "text": "2.3 Rockies Fandom\nMuch to my delight, Todd Helton was elected to the baseball Hall of Fame this January, forever to be enshrined as one of the greatest players to ever play the game.\nIn an interview capturing his post-election emotions, he said, “‘playing’ 162 games, there’s sometimes where you’re just not feeling it…and you go out and you play at Coors Field…and the fans get you energized…and they get you ready to play. And you never know when the one kid is there that that’s his first time watching you play. So that’s what I thought about when I when out there to play…”\nBeing now in my thirties, I’ve grown too old to look up to athletes or imagine that a comment like this fully explains their motivations. Yet, I cannot deny that I was that kid that night, September 18, 2001, and express my gratitude to the Toddfather for memories that will last a lifetime."

    "text": "2.1 My First Game\nIt’s September 18, 2001, one week after 9/11 and also my ninth birthday. The country is stirring itself back into action with the hope that regular activities will provide a reprieve from the pain.\nAt 5:30 AM, I’m already up and ready for my very first professional baseball game—the tickets for which my Dad secured and they just so happened to be on my birthday! Rising early is part eagerness and part necessity. To get to Coors Field, my family and I need to drive 550 miles from my hometown of Billings, Montana to Denver, Colorado. As we cross through Wyoming, little do I know that soon I will witness the most exciting in-person MLB game of my life.\nThe Colorado Rockies opponent, you ask? The soon-to-be World Series champion Arizona Diamondbacks. Before the game, I stand on the third base line and after three attempts because he was so tall and I so short finally get Randy Johnson to sign my program. The starting pitcher for the Diamondbacks that night is his counterpart in pitching dominance, Curt Schilling. Johnson would win the Cy Young Award that season with Schilling finishing second in voting. They would together pitch a postseason for the record books.\nThe 62-81 Rockies seem a weak match for the Diamondbacks. Their chances look even more bleak when the Diamondbacks score a fat 6 runs in the top of the first inning. But these are things my 9 year old brain doesn’t even care to compute amid the sight of vast green grass, Todd Helton throwing warmup grounders to his fellow infielders, the sound of the public address announcer belting out what may well be a roll call for heaven.\nAs good as Schilling is, no pitcher simply walks into Coors Field and pitches well. This was especially the case before 2002 when the Rockies had their famous epiphany about limiting the offense-enhancing effects of Denver’s elevation and aridity by storing baseballs in a humidor. In the third inning, Jose Ortiz and Todd Helton hit back to back home runs to cut the Diamondbacks lead in half. By the end of the fifth inning, the Rockies narrow the Diamondbacks lead to 6-5 and send Schilling packing early. Entering the bottom of the ninth, the Rockies and Diamondbacks have scored a combined 17 runs with the Rockies trailing 9-8.\nAt this point, what more could my 9 year old self have asked for? My family had driven me across three states to see a baseball game. I got Randy Johnson’s autograph. Todd Helton had homered. I ate some Dippin’ Dots.\nMy heart was filled to its brim, and then bang, Todd Helton homers again. A small crowd for Coors yet a huge crowd in my eyes erupts as the Rockies tie the game 9-9. For a kid from Montana, I was as wide-eyed as eyes can widen.\nThe next batter, Jeff Cirillo, decides to join Helton in making my first game one for the ages. He too hits a home run, the second set of back-to-back home runs of the night for the Rockies—this time off Byun Hyung Kim, a foreshadowing of World Series meltdowns soon to come.\nHaving trailed the entire game until the final inning, the Rockies win 10-9 in exhilarating style."

    "text": "2.2 Back-to-Back Home Run Endings\nMy Dad told me that I’d probably never see another game in-person that ends in back-to-back home runs for the rest of my life. And he’s probably right. From 1990 to 2020 (the years of focus for this project), only 27 games ended in back-to-back home runs.

And you never know when the one kid is there that that’s his first time watching you play. So that’s what I thought about when I when out there to play…”\nBeing now in my thirties, I’ve grown too old to look up to athletes or imagine that a comment like this fully explains their motivations. Yet, I cannot deny that I was that kid that night, September 18, 2001, and express my gratitude to the Toddfather for memories that will last a lifetime."

    "text": "To do data analysis, we obviously need some data. What kind of data? Because dynasty league rules often specify a maximum number of plate appearances or innings pitched before a player loses prospect eligibility, we need the most granular level of data possible–play by play data.\nSeason-long data is useless because players have inconsistent volumes of plate appearances and innings pitched, especially in their first season. We also want to be able to compare players with each other, and inconsistent data (even a collection of individual gamelogs/box scores) will skew player comparisons.\nThis is where the amazing people in the baseball universe absolutely shine. Retrosheet is an all-volunteer nonprofit that has tirelessly computerized play-by-play logs of thousands of MLB games. I highly encourage you checking out their website.\nGetting Retrosheet data in a more workable format was a bit intimidating for me since this is my first large-scale analysis, so I looked around for more structured data in an Excel file format with Retrosheet data as a starting point. I found a dataset in csv format from Ryan Brill at the University of Pennsylvania, who from what I can tell did the time-consuming work of adding in Weighted On-Base Average (wOBA) statistics for each event. More on wOBA in a bit.\nIn addition to including wOBA, the dataset has a lot of things going for it:\n\nFrom a credible institution and researcher.\nLarge sample size (1990 to 2020)\nModern era (more relevant than 1960 to 1990, for example)\n\nThere were a significant number of transformations I made to the dataset, which included:\n\nJoining the main dataset with another based on Player ID to include player dates like their debut and last game played, age, etc.\nFiltering for players who made their debut in 1990 or later.\nDistinguishing batters and pitchers so that we can isolate analysis for both. To our delight (Bartolo) and chagrin (Chien-Ming Wang?), pitchers used to hit! And batters actually still do pitch on occasion!\nFor pitchers, distinguishing starters from relievers. Oh yeah, and that Shohei guy…distinguishing two-way players from one-way players. (Technically, Shohei won’t appear in this analysis, but Rick Ankiel…)\nDistinguishing Active and Inactive players.\nCreating a rolling wOBA calculation for each player for every “plate appearance” and wOBA at specific milestones like 150 plate appearances, 600 plate appearances, 215 batters faced, etc."

    "section": "2.3 The State of the Rockies",
    "text": "2.3 The State of the Rockies\nAs satisfying as it was to look back on fond childhood and Rockies memories, the Rockies franchise is currently in shambles. They lost a franchise-worst 103 games last year despite having a $171 million dollar payroll. This year they a succesful season will likely be measured on the basis of not losing 100 games again. They opened their season by losing their first game 16-1 and allowing 13 runs in a single inning. Not great, Bob.\nLast year’s World Series proved that losing 100 games does not prevent teams from fairly imminent success. Both the 2023 WS-winning Texas Rangers and WS-losing Arizona Diamondbacks lost 100 games just two years before. But the chances the Rockies could replicate this reversal in even five years seems a far-fetched notion. Organizational incompetence is the primary issue, and the condition of their roster a devastating symptom.\nThe lone players on their major league roster that appear to have a shot at playing leading roles in any future competitive window are 25-year old Nolan Jones and 22-year old Ezequiel Tovar, both entering their sophomore seasons. Jones was worth almost four wins himself last season compared to a typical replacement-level player (Wins Above Replacement - WAR). Tovar finished second in Gold Glove voting for his defensive prowess, putting up 1.6 WAR despite having a relatively weak offensive season. The Rockies demonstrated their faith in his talent by signing him to a $63 millon dollar contract through 2030.\nGiven the woeful state of their roster, it is no surprise that I and fellow Rockies fans are intensely interested in the development of Jones and Tovar. If Jones regresses—some suspect his success last season was somewhat unsustainable due to an extremely high batting average on balls in play—and Tovar doesn’t progress offensively, the Rockies will be in an even worse predicament than they already are. If they both build on their rookie performances and top prospects like Adael Amador emerge as contributors, the Rockies future will look less apocalyptic—perhaps even slightly hopeful for the next generation of nine year old fans."

Before we go any further, I want to acknowledge that yes, fantasy baseball is kind of a ridiculous and goofy hobby. But you can imagine that as a Rockies fan, the solace “fantasy” baseball provides has been prescribed by my doctor :)\nParticularly because I play in a shallow dynasty league (12 teams) but roster a lot of prospects (20) with players losing prospect eligibility at 200 at-bats and 66 innings pitched, I am constantly faced with the decision of whether to cut or hold a prospect during their rookie season.\nTo this point, I have always felt like my decisions about cutting or holding a prospect, especially less renowned prospects, were based on feelings rather than data, too influenced by highlights and small sample sizes, and generally lacking.

My goal with this project will be to help us increase our confidence in our understanding of how a player’s initial performance correlated with their career performance.\nWhile this study is descriptive and not predictive…\nIdeally it will help us fantasy baseball managers make more informed decisions—perhaps even league-winning decisions—when the “roster crunch” inevitably and repeatedly arrives."

My goal with this project will be to help us increase our confidence in our understanding of how a player’s initial performance correlated with their career performance.\nWhile this study is descriptive and not predictive…\nIdeally it will help us as fantasy baseball managers make more informed decisions—perhaps even league-winning decisions—when the “roster crunch” inevitably and repeatedly arrives."

    "text": "3.2 Data\nTo do data analysis, we obviously need some data. What kind of data? Because dynasty league rules often specify a maximum number of plate appearances or innings pitched before a player loses prospect eligibility, we need the most granular level of data possible–play by play data.\nSeason-long data is useless because players have inconsistent volumes of plate appearances and innings pitched, especially in their first season. We also want to be able to compare players with each other, and inconsistent data (even a collection of individual gamelogs/box scores) will skew player comparisons.\nThis is where the amazing people in the baseball universe absolutely shine. Retrosheet is an all-volunteer nonprofit that has tirelessly computerized play-by-play logs of thousands of MLB games. I highly encourage you checking out their website.\nGetting Retrosheet data in a more workable format was a bit intimidating for me since this is my first large-scale analysis, so I looked around for more structured data in an Excel file format with Retrosheet data as a starting point. I found a dataset in csv format from Ryan Brill at the University of Pennsylvania, who from what I can tell did the time-consuming work of adding in Weighted On-Base Average (wOBA) statistics for each event. More on wOBA in a bit.\nIn addition to including wOBA, the dataset has a lot of things going for it:\n\nFrom a credible institution and researcher.\nLarge sample size (1990 to 2020)\nModern era (more relevant than 1960 to 1990, for example)\n\nThere were a significant number of transformations I made to the dataset, which included:\n\nJoining the main dataset with another based on Player ID to include player dates like their debut and last game played, age, etc.\nFiltering for players who made their debut in 1990 or later.\nDistinguishing batters and pitchers so that we can isolate analysis for both. To our delight (Bartolo) and chagrin (Chien-Ming Wang?), pitchers used to hit! And batters actually still do pitch on occasion!\nFor pitchers, distinguishing starters from relievers.

    "text": "1.1 My First Game\nIt’s September 18, 2001, one week after 9/11 and also my ninth birthday. The country is stirring itself back into action with the hope that regular activities will provide a reprieve from the pain.\nAt 5:30 AM, I’m already up and ready to see my very first professional baseball game. Rising early is part eagerness and part necessity. To get to Coors Field, my family and I need to drive 550 miles from my hometown of Billings, Montana to Denver, Colorado. As we cross through Wyoming, little do I know that soon I will witness the most exciting in-person baseball game of my life.\nThe Colorado Rockies opponent, you ask? The soon-to-be World Series champion Arizona Diamondbacks. Before the game, I stand on the third base line and after three attempts because he is so tall and I so short finally get Randy Johnson to sign my program. The starting pitcher for the Diamondbacks that night is his counterpart in pitching dominance, Curt Schilling. Johnson would win the Cy Young Award that season with Schilling finishing second in voting. They would together pitch a postseason for the record books.\nOn the surface, below the surface, above the surface, the 62-81 Rockies seem a weak match for the Diamondbacks. Their chances look even more bleak when the Diamondbacks score six runs in the top of the first inning. But these are things my nine-year old brain doesn’t even care to compute amid the sights of perfect green grass, the motion of Todd Helton throwing warmup grounders to his fellow infielders, the sound of the public address announcer belting out what may well be a roll call for heaven.\nAs good as Schilling is, one does not simply walk into Coors Field and pitch well. This was especially the case before 2002 when the Rockies had their famous epiphany about limiting the offense-enhancing effects of Denver’s elevation and aridity by storing baseballs in a humidor. As if on some sort of Mountain Time cue, Jose Ortiz and Todd Helton hit back to back home runs in the third inning to cut the Diamondbacks lead in half. By the end of the fifth inning, the Rockies narrow their deficit to 6-5 and send Schilling packing early. Entering the bottom of the ninth, the Rockies and Diamondbacks have scored a combined 17 runs with the Rockies trailing 9-8.\nAt this point, what more could my nine-year-old self have asked for? My family had driven me across three states to see a baseball game. I got Randy Johnson’s autograph. Todd Helton had homered. I ate some Dippin’ Dots.\nMy heart was filled to its brim, and then bang, Todd Helton drives a ball deep to center for his second home run of the game. A small crowd for Coors yet a huge crowd in my eyes erupts as the Rockies tie the game 9-9. For a kid from Montana, I was as wide-eyed as eyes widen.\nThe next batter, Jeff Cirillo, decides to join Helton in making my first game one for the ages. He too hits a home run, the second set of back-to-back home runs of the night for the Rockies—this time off Byun Hyung Kim, a foreshadowing of World Series meltdowns to come.\nHaving trailed the entire game until the final inning, the Rockies win 10-9 in exhilarating style.\n\n\n\nMy Dad and I at the game…"

    "section": "1.4 The State of the Rockies",
    "text": "1.4 The State of the Rockies\nAs satisfying as it was to look back on fond childhood and Rockies memories, the Rockies franchise is currently in shambles. They lost a franchise-worst 103 games last year despite having a $171 million dollar payroll. This year a successful season will likely be measured on the basis of not losing 100 games again. They opened this season by losing their first game 16-1 and allowing 13 runs in a single inning, an embarrassing outing and what feels emblematic of the remaining season.\nLast year’s World Series proved that losing 100 games does not prevent teams from fairly imminent success. Both the 2023 WS-winning Texas Rangers and WS-losing Arizona Diamondbacks lost 100 games just two years before. But the chances the Rockies could replicate this reversal in even five years seems a far-fetched notion. Organizational incompetence is the primary issue, and the condition of their roster the primary symptom.\nThe lone players on their major league roster that appear to have a shot at playing leading roles in any future competitive window are 25-year old Nolan Jones and 22-year old Ezequiel Tovar, both now in their sophomore seasons. Jones was worth almost four wins himself last season compared to a typical replacement-level player as measured by Wins Above Replacement (WAR). Tovar finished 2023 as a Gold Glove finalist for his defensive prowess, putting up 1.6 WAR despite having a relatively weak offensive season. The Rockies demonstrated their faith in his talent by signing him to a $63 millon dollar contract through 2030.\n\n\n\nEzequiel Tovar and Nolan Jones, Credit: AP Photo, Jeff Roberson\n\n\nGiven the woeful state of their roster, it is no surprise that I and fellow Rockies fans are intensely interested in the development of Jones and Tovar. If Jones regresses—some suspect his success last season was somewhat unsustainable due to an extremely high batting average on balls in play, and his 2024 is already off to a woeful start—and Tovar doesn’t progress offensively, the Rockies will be in an even worse predicament than they already are. If they both build on their rookie performances and top prospects like Adael Amador emerge as contributors, the Rockies future will look less apocalyptic, perhaps even slightly hopeful—at least enough for the next generation of wide-eyed nine-year old fans."

    "text": "2.1 Project Focus\nAs I pondered the possible futures for the Rockies, I couldn’t help but wonder what a player’s rookie season tells us about that player—kind of like what an initial interaction might tell us about the possibilities of friendship or a relationship with someone we meet. In more technical terms, does a player’s rookie season performance correlate with/predict their career performance, and if so, to what extent?\nThis is a question I have been asking even more so as an avid dynasty fantasy baseball player. Before we go any further, I want to acknowledge that yes, fantasy baseball is built upon a ridiculous premise and by all accounts is a goofy hobby. But you can imagine that as a Rockies fan, the solace “fantasy” baseball provides has been prescribed by my doctor :)\nFor the uninitiated, dynasty fantasy baseball is just like regular fantasy baseball, only you also have players who have yet to reach the major leagues on your team—referred to as prospects—and you typically keep all your players as long as you like year after year. The goal is to build a “dynasty” that will win your league at least one year and ideally multiple times over.\nParticularly because I play in a shallow dynasty league (only 12 teams) but roster a lot of prospects (20) with players losing prospect eligibility at 200 at-bats and 66 innings pitched, I am constantly faced with the predicament of whether to cut/trade or hold a prospect during their rookie season. I simply don’t have room to keep them all on my major league roster. Some players make this decision easy (Corbin Carroll last year) and others make it hard (Brandon Pfaadt last year).\nUp until this point, I have always felt like my decisions about discarding or holding a prospect, especially less renowned prospects, were based more on feelings rather than data, too influenced by highlights and small sample sizes, and generally lacking. Perhaps you feel the same?\nIn light of this and my intrigue into Jones’ and Tovar’s futures (I also have Tovar on my fantasy team, no surprise!), I set out to analyze rookie and career performances for players who debuted over the span of 20+ years (1990 to 2010) to gain a better understanding of what this relationship has looked like historically.\nWhile this project is descriptive analysis and not predictive, I like what Ariel Cohen, an expert fantasy baseball player/analyst and actuary by day, I believe, writes…\n\n“From an actuary’s perspective, the key motto for statistical models is that the past is predictive of the future. In my field, we base quantitative predictions on the tenet that given the same long-term conditions, past numerical outcomes and distributions (if properly parameterized) will continue for the foreseeable future.”\n\nWhile we won’t get to the point of building models, the core principle to reiterate is that the past will generally have something valuable to tell us about the present and future.\nIdeally, what we learn will help us as fantasy baseball managers make more informed decisions when the “roster crunch” inevitably and repeatedly arrives. Maybe you just need a small edge to bring home a trophy that your loved ones will undoubtedly be so impressed by!"

    "text": "3.1 Weighted On-Base Average (wOBA)\nIf you haven’t heard of Weighted On-Base Average (wOBA), I highly recommend you read FanGraphs’ primer. Credit is due to Tom Tango, the creator of the statistic, who we will come back to later.\nI won’t rehash too many details, but my key takeaway is that wOBA is a comprehensive offensive statistic which more accurately quantifies the value of a batter’s performance compared to other traditional statistics. Batting Average (BA), On-Base Percentage (OBP), Slugging Percentage (SLG), On-Base + Slugging Percentage (OPS), can’t fully capture the nuance of a batter’s value like wOBA does. This is because wOBA measures the precise effect a walk, single, double, triple, home run, even hit-by-pitches (HBP) have on whether teams score a run or not and bakes that into the statistic.\nFanGraphs includes some general guidelines to evaluating what a good or bad wOBA is for batters, included below. It’s essentially equivalent to a good or bad OBP since wOBA is always scaled to league average OBP. These rating groups and their corresponding values may fluctuate in small ways over long periods of time, but we will use these ratings—or grades as I refer to them—throughout this analysis. For our purposes, wOBA will serve as a catch-all statistic to measure player performance. Even though wOBA is an offensive statistic, we can measure batters’ wOBA against pitchers to evaluate pitchers and invert the grading scale.\n\n\n\nSource: FanGraphs"

    "text": "3.4 Data Context\n\nAll batters and starting pitchers who debuted from 1990 through 2010 are included\n\nNon-starting pitchers are not included\nPitchers hitting (it used to be a thing!) and batters pitching (it still is a thing!) are excluded\n\nStats are from the 1990 season through 2020\nIntentional walks and sacrifice bunts are by default excluded from wOBA, so Plate Appearances (PAs) and Batters Faced (BF) are only those that ended in a wOBA-producing event\nAn Initial wOBA Grade of “DNQ” stands for Did Not Qualify, meaning a player did not reach the stated Plate Appearances or Batters Faced thresholds\n\nFor example, a batter who only had 120 career plate appearances did not qualify for either the 150 or 600 PA thresholds\n\nThere is also a DNQ threshold set for the Post wOBA Grade to avoid comparing a player who for example made 150 plate appearances and then only 1 more after\n\nFor 150 PAs, a batter had to have reached 600 PAs to qualify for a Post wOBA Grade of Good, Average, or Bad\nFor 600 PAs, 1800 PAs\nFor 215 Batters Faced (BF), 860 BFs\nFor 860 BFs, 2580 BFs\n\nIf a player did not meet those thresholds, they receive a DNQ post grade, which is categorized as a “Bad” wOBA grade\nThe Batters Faced threshold was chosen to equal roughly 50 Innings Pitched (215 BFs) and 200 Innings Pitched (860 BFs)\nProspect ranks are from Baseball America preseason Top 100 Prospects lists\n\nIf a prospect was on a top 100 list but fell off the list prior to their debut, they were not considered a top 100 prospect\nIf a prospect was not on a top 100 list when they debuted but were added before they lost prospect eligibility, they are included (confirm this)"

    "text": "3.6 Initial Observations\nDid you notice anything interesting in the charts above? A couple observations stuck out to me.\n\nNearly a third of batters did not even reach 150 PA and nearly half did not reach 600 PA. “Cup of coffee” players are aplenty.\nAs I mentioned earlier, a batter who hit for a Good wOBA over their first 150 PA was more likely to have a Bad wOBA grade for the remainder of their career than Good.\n\nRemember that a grade of Did Not Qualify, meaning in this case that they didn’t reach 600 PA, falls under a Bad grade. So both regression and attrition are contributing to this.\n\n\nWhile this is interesting at a macro-level, watch what happens when we look at groups of batters based on their prospect rank. Prospects are grouped by prospects who ranked 1 through 25, 26 through 50, 51 through 75, 75 through 100, and Unranked—labeled above each chart."

    "text": "3.7 Observations\nThe observations we made when looking at all batters remain true only when looking at certain groups of prospects, particularly unranked prospects. * For instance, a large percentage of the batters who did not qualify were unranked prospects.\nYou probably already sensed this, but a majority of batters are unranked prospects. They weight heavily in the graph with all batters, making it hard to see the effect of top ranked prospects.\nCan you any spot differences between the 150 PA and 600 PA graphs?\nPurely based on looking at them, especially for prospects ranked 1 through 75, the 600 PA graphs appear more orderly. Additionally, it looks like more batters are falling into the “Average” wOBA grade bucket. This speaks to larger sample sizes helping to reduce noise and volatility."

There were tiny inconsistencies for a number of players like AJ Burnett and A.J. Burnett for example. I went about this process far too manually not knowing this package existed. Given that there are about 20,000 packages available in the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), I recommend looking around for relevant packages or methods before doing a task to make your life easier in the long run. I started using the fuzzyjoin and tidystringdist packages at work after this somewhat painful experience."

    "text": "9.7 Resources\n\nGoogle Analytics Certificate Program\nThis project served as my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate Program. They have some default projects you can pick, but I definitely wanted to do something of greater interest to me to help stay motivated.\nI found the program to be a solid overview of data analytics and key tools. From there, I felt more confident to branch out into more specific areas and tools that I had yet to work with. Since I love the big picture, I found their breakdown of the data analysis process extremely helpful. This was my north star throughout my project.\n\nAsk\nPrepare\nProcess\nAnalyze\nShare\nAct\n\n\n\nStack Overflow\nWhen I first started my project, the only code examples I had were from the certificate program. As I plodded along, there were hundreds of times where I knew what end result I wanted (for example, a new column of data) but didn’t know what code to write to get there. Stack Overflow was enormously helpful in getting closer to the specific code I needed as long as I could formulate a question that was in the ballpark of what I was looking for. Of the hundreds of questions I had, I only wound up having to ask a minor one where I couldn’t find an existing answer. That’s quite a testament to the amount of information available and incredible credit to the individuals who provide answers. Where do you they find the time?!\nI recognize that AI tools may have reached the point of being a more efficient tool than combing through sites like Stack Overflow. When I first started my project, I don’t think Chat-GPT or other similar tools had quite caught on like they have today. It may have been a poor decision, but I decided that I wasn’t going to use AI tools for this project. This was primarily because I felt like having to struggle a bit, figure things out more manually, etc., would help me acquire a deeper understanding of the concepts than having code more auto-generated. I also felt like I wouldn’t be able to properly validate if the AI-generated solutions had errors or not.\n\n\nFunction Reference for Packages\nFor all the packages I used, the function reference/reference manual was enormously helpful to get my code to work and accomplish the goals of my project. Here is the manual for dplyr as an example.\nIf you click on a specific function, it tells you what exactly must and can be included (referred to as arguments). They also provide examples, which I found even more helpful.\nIf I could go back, I would probably read beforehand through the different functions in dplyr and the other core packages I used, as I had times where I stumbled upon a function too late—add_count() is one example. It’s hard to know all the functions you need beforehand, but especially for dplyr, this would have made my life easier.\nFrom the package website, there is typically a link to GitHub, which has an “Issues” tab that can be helpful if you feel like something isn’t working exactly as expected—gt package example.\n\n\nPackage Cheatsheets\nI believe the ggplot2 package is one of the most downloaded packages from R’s package repository. With that, I suspect it is also one of the most popular cheatsheets. While the function reference gets to a more helpful level of detail, these cheatsheets provide a bird’s eye everything a package can do. The ggplot2 cheatsheet is great because it gives you a sense of all the data visualizations that are possible and the different components of plots. Not every package has a cheatsheet, but it’s a must-use when available.\n\n\nR for the Rest of Us\nI’m not sure where I first heard about R for the Rest of Us, but I highly recommend them if you are new to coding and interested in R. I’ve yet to take any of their full courses and didn’t do their R in 3 Months despite strongly considering it, but even signing up for their emails, listening to their podcast, and watching their shorter YouTube videos has been a huge help. From learning of new packages to making visualizations look prettier to improving workflows, they have a lot to offer. The best part about it is that they gear themselves towards folks with a non-coding background.\n\n\nYouTube\nSome channels I found helpful included Riffomonas Project, Equitable Equations, and Posit PBC—particularly Quarto-specific videos. On the statistics side of things, I joined the StatQuest throng to refresh and check my understanding of statistical concepts."

    "section": "10.1 General Reflections",
    "text": "10.1 General Reflections\n\nProject-Based Learning\nOne of the most constant refrains of advice I keep hearing for growing your skills in data analytics is to do projects. I wholeheartedly agree.\nThere are a number of reasons why doing projects is such an effective way to learn. The two that stand out the most to me are 1) repetition and 2) being forced to simultaneously and continuously stretch between executing a big idea that will provide value to others while attending to extremely small details. The first is self-explanatory, particularly as it relates to coding, but cannot be emphasized enough. The second is a constant challenge, but it captures the beauty of data analytics, in that when you are pulling your hair out over a detail that is 1/1000th of your whole project, you know that ultimately all of those small details weave together into something significant that will tangibly help others.\n\n\nSolving Problems, Answering Crucial Questions\nWell, at least that’s the idea—to tangibly help others. Unfortunately, it can be easy to slip into data analysis done solely for the act of analyzing data or to ascertain something more trivial. For non-baseball fans, this whole project could be categorized as such, but I hope that those of you who are diehard baseball and fantasy baseball fans derived some value from it.\nToeing the fine line between valuable and trivial analysis has reinforced for me that the purpose of data analytics is to help solve real problems and answer crucial questions, not to analyze data—as counter-intuitive as that sounds. Analyzing data is a means to a greater end. With that in mind, the most vital element of data analytics is arguably uncovering the most important questions.\n\n\nDomain Knowledge\nWhat helped me arrive at a good question (at least in my opinion) is that I myself was the audience, the end-user, the decision-maker. I root for Nolan Jones and Ezequiel Tovar as a Rockies fan and make regular, difficult (relatively speaking) decisions as a dynasty fantasy baseball manager to keep or cut/trade players.\nThis idea speaks to another constant refrain I hear in the data space: that at least some understanding of the domain/subject/business will make you a better data analyst. In my day jobs, I’ve experienced this to an even greater extent. Knowing the goals of different nonprofit and government programs that I’ve worked with has helped me quickly zero in on important questions, relevant data, and appropriate methods for analysis and reporting.\nGiven how overwhelming it feels to learn and keep up with the number of technical skills and tools needed in the data space, it’s encouraging to remember that domain knowledge, not to mention other related skills like communication, project management, working with people, is a significant facet of what makes an effective analyst.\n\n\nScope & Scope Creep\nIf I could give any advice to the me who was just about to embark on this project a year ago, it would be to simplify my research question and narrow the scope of my project. Multiple datasets (play-by-play and prospect ranks), multiple player types (batters and pitchers), multiple periods (150 and 600 plate appearances, 215 and 860 batters faced), multiple analyses (wOBA grades, percentage outcomes, numeric outcomes, linear correlation)… it simply became too much. This was primarily because I was also learning R while trying to achieve all of this. Had I already possessed the skills, I think it would have been a reasonable scope, but learning and doing it all at the same time was a lot.\nAdditionally, there were many lines of code that I wrote that went unused, analyses and visualizations that ultimately were superseded by what I felt were better analyses and visualizations. I think some of this is natural and also demonstrates that I was trying to convey the analysis in the clearest and most valuable way for you as the audience. However, in the future I need to be more vigilant to guard against scope creep. Better defining my research questions and project scope from the get-go should help with this.\n\n\nDon’t Be Afraid of Programming\nTo be honest, coding is still a bit scary. Learning a programming language like R is usually referred to as a steep learning curve, which is definitely true, but what is less mentioned is that even an intermediate grasp of a language is extremely valuable. It’s not as if you have to reach the top of the curve to start drawing value from it. In my day job, incorporating R has given me the ability to both obtain and work with larger/more unwieldy datasets that would be extremely difficult if not impossible to do with no or low-coding tools. In my personal experience, it has been so worth the effort.\nThe tidyverse in particular includes fairly user-friendly packages with command language that is designed to be highly learnable for data scientists and analysts. Learning dplyr with a smaller dataset feels like a good starting place in my perhaps naive opinion.\n\n\nR & the R Community are Amazing\nI’m sure other programming languages like Python are also amazing, but the R community regularly receives praise for being highly supportive and inclusive. I’ve found that to be accurate from observing people generously answering questions on platforms like Stack Overflow; to putting out free resources, books, and workshops; to hosting local conferences and events; and perhaps most of all, developing packages that make coding easier and are free for anyone to use.\nIf you’re interested in data analytics and learning a programming language but have some natural trepidation, just know that there is a whole community of people who work diligently to make it accessible for all willing to make the effort."

    "text": "10.2 Technical Reflections\n\n\n\nSource: Yahoo Sports\n\n\n\nRundowns/Pickles\nYes, I know we’ve wandered too far from baseball! Let’s enjoy this jewel of a GIF to help illustrate a more technical observation about my project.\nAt many points, I felt like I was attempting to do with my data what the St. Louis Cardinals were attempting to do with the baserunner, Jacoby Ellsbury, in this “rundown” / “pickle” in baseball terms. I was trying to write code to get the data into the format I needed but doing so in an inefficient way. In baseball, rundowns should generally take the fielding team two or three throws maximum to tag the runner out. Cleaning and wrangling data is similar.\nThe biggest example of this was when I was working with the prospect rank dataset that I mentioned previously. I’ll spare you the gory details, but reflecting back on it, I should have begun by writing down each issue with the data, identifying specific intermediate states for the data in addition to the end state, and doing further research on other possible ways to address the issues. By rushing into it, it actually took me far longer than it would have with more planning.\nIf anything, I’ll take this GIF with me as a helpful analogy for what to avoid in the future!\n\n\nCode Smells\nI can’t remember how I stumbled across this article, but I’m happy I did. I found it insightful despite a lack of proposed alternatives because it got my brain thinking about good and bad code, something I knew I would have to turn my attention towards eventually. For my project, I was not extremely concerned with inefficient code as long as it was not egregious because my main objective was to “get the job done” and figured I would improve my coding skills/code over time.\nAs an example, you can see my case_when sins.\n\n# convert wOBA into wOBA grades\nall_batter_career_data_by_ID &lt;- all_batter_career_data_by_ID %&gt;%\n  mutate(FIRST_600_WOBA_GRADE = case_when(\n    FIRST_600_WOBA_GRADE == 0 ~ \"DNQ\",\n    FIRST_600_WOBA &gt;= .400 ~ \"Elite\",\n    between(FIRST_600_WOBA, .370, .399) ~ \"Great\",\n    between(FIRST_600_WOBA, .340, .369) ~ \"Good\",\n    between(FIRST_600_WOBA, .320, .339) ~ \"Average\",\n    between(FIRST_600_WOBA, .310, .319) ~ \"Below Average\",\n    between(FIRST_600_WOBA, .291, .309) ~ \"Poor\",\n    FIRST_600_WOBA &lt;= .290 ~ \"Awful\"),\n    FIRST_600_WOBA_GRADE = factor(FIRST_600_WOBA_GRADE, levels = \n                                  c(\"Elite\", \"Great\", \"Good\", \"Average\",\n                                    \"Below Average\", \"Poor\", \"Awful\", \"DNQ\")))\n\nEchoing the author of the post, I am not aware of a great alternative to this. This also makes intuitive sense to me. When the value is this, then make it ~ that. Regardless, code smells is a great concept for someone in my shoes who is now at the point of wanting to write much better code.\n\n\nCode Conciseness\nRelated to this is the idea of code conciseness. From what I gather, code should be as readable and concise as possible.\nI felt like my code was fairly readable—perhaps only because I added an excessive amount of comments every step of the way.\nAs for conciseness? Nope!\nFor example, look at this disaster if you are sick enough (viewer discretion advised). The first part of the code is just one of the many dataframes I created that you see in the second part of the code, and that wasn’t all of them.\n\n# calculate wOBA for each batter after 900 career plate appearances\npost_900_woba_bat &lt;- bat_wOBA_log_debut_1990_on_no_pit %&gt;%\n  group_by(BAT_ID) %&gt;%\n  filter(CAREER_PA_WOBA_NUM &gt; 900) %&gt;%\n  summarise(POST_900_WOBA = mean(EVENT_WOBA))\n\n# bring batter wOBA at different plate appearance totals into summary dataframe\nall_batter_career_data_by_ID &lt;- all_batter_career_data_by_ID %&gt;%\n  left_join(first_300_woba_bat, by = \"BAT_ID\") %&gt;%\n  left_join(first_450_woba_bat, by = \"BAT_ID\") %&gt;% \n  left_join(first_900_woba_bat, by = \"BAT_ID\") %&gt;% \n  left_join(post_300_woba_bat, by = \"BAT_ID\") %&gt;%\n  left_join(post_450_woba_bat, by = \"BAT_ID\") %&gt;% \n  left_join(post_900_woba_bat, by = \"BAT_ID\") \n\nA more efficient way to do this would have been:\n\nall_batter_career_data_by_ID &lt;- bat_wOBA_log_debut_1990_on_no_pit %&gt;%\n  group_by(BAT_ID) %&gt;% \n1  summarise(FIRST_300_WOBA = mean(EVENT_WOBA[CAREER_PA_WOBA_NUM &lt;= 300]),\n            FIRST_450_WOBA = mean(EVENT_WOBA[CAREER_PA_WOBA_NUM &lt;= 450]),\n            FIRST_900_WOBA = mean(EVENT_WOBA[CAREER_PA_WOBA_NUM &lt;= 900]),\n            POST_300_WOBA = mean(EVENT_WOBA[CAREER_PA_WOBA_NUM &gt; 300]), \n            POST_450_WOBA = mean(EVENT_WOBA[CAREER_PA_WOBA_NUM &gt; 450]),\n            POST_900_WOBA = mean(EVENT_WOBA[CAREER_PA_WOBA_NUM &gt; 900])) %&gt;% \n  left_join(all_batter_career_data_by_ID, \n2            .,\n3            by = \"BAT_ID\")\n\n\n1\n\nThe [ ] subsets the dataframe to only focus on rows where that condition is met.\n\n2\n\nThe . indicates the summary table generated by the group_by and summarise functions.\n\n3\n\nJoin the summary table to the all_batter_career_data_by_ID dataframe based on batter IDs.\n\n\n\n\nThis method calculates all the needed wOBA numbers in one shot and avoids creating intermediate objects that would have to be deleted later.\n\n\nFunctions & Iteration\nThe above code is a huge improvement, but I suspect it may be possible to do even better if we wrote a function or iterated in some way.\nHadley Wickham, the man who created the tidyverse packages that I used so much for this project, says that if you copy/paste code twice to write a function.\nThat sounds easy enough, right?\nWell, my initial foray into writing functions was a bit mystifying. I was able to successfully write a function to create a gt table theme, as I mentioned previously.\nI also wrote a function that I wound up not using—drawing insight from this post and another.\n\n# write function to reclassify wOBA grades to numbers\nwoba_grade_to_num_fn &lt;- function(x) {\n  case_when({{x}} == \"Elite\" ~ 8, \n            {{x}} == \"Great\" ~ 7,\n            {{x}} == \"Good\" ~ 6,\n            {{x}} == \"Average\" ~ 5,\n            {{x}} == \"Below Average\" ~ 4,\n            {{x}} == \"Poor\" ~ 3,\n            {{x}} == \"Awful\" ~ 2,\n            {{x}} == \"DNQ\" ~ 1)\n}\n\n# apply the function (example)\nmutate(across(c(FIRST_150_WOBA_GRADE, \n                POST_150_WOBA_GRADE, \n                FIRST_600_WOBA_GRADE,\n                POST_600_WOBA_GRADE), \n                ~ woba_grade_to_num_fn(.)))\n\nI also attempted to use the purrr package one or two times, but I didn’t get very far.\nAt the end of the day, I don’t feel too bad about not making much headway when it comes to functions and iteration since it is a bit more advanced, but I’m glad I got a taste and have direction in terms of what to learn/tackle next."

You can be the judge of whether I stretched too far :)\n\nPessimistic Analytics\nI recently listened to an episode of the Analytics Power Hour where Kathleen Maley stated that 80% of analytics projects fail. Failure wasn’t defined as not completing a project but rather that it did not provide the business or organization value.\nWhile it was likely an illogical leap to apply this concept directly to my project, it’s a leap that my mind must have made somewhere along the way. I started to think that I had a 1 in 5 chance of succeeding. This was layered on top of learning a programming language, my project taking an extremely long time, and working alone. There were times when I thought what I was working on would never see the light of day. I felt a bit like Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) who epitomizes a philosophy of pessimism in the novel-based film Se7en (minute 2:37 to 3:35 in the clip below).\n\nEven having finished my project and reaching insights that seem at least close to actionable, I have yet to fully expel this sentiment. This line in particular lingers: “Even the most promising clues only lead to others.”\nSomething about the pursuit of knowledge—in analytics, the pursuit of actionable knowledge through data—has a way of leaving me pessimistic. The effect of our knowledge—even a great deal of knowledge—particularly on the most important areas in personal and communal life, feels so limited.\nAs much as I would like to be free of such thoughts, I think a small dose of pessimism may actually be helpful for me as an analyst. It serves to an extent as an internal filter, pushing me towards what matters and away from what is irrelevant."

With a simple function like the one in my code below, I got back a summary of the dataset that told me things like what classes the different variables were (character, numeric, date, etc.), how many and what percentage of NA values there were in each column, the min and max values of each column, etc. This was particularly helpful as a starting point for data cleaning.\n\nskim_without_charts(game_data)"

This dataset was separate from the primary dataset that included all player statistics and game data, so I had to figure out a way to join them together in order to link player statistics and player prospect ranks.\nBecause the prospect dataset did not include unique player IDs, I was forced to join them together based on player names. Given that multiple players have the same names—for instance, did you know that a second Pedro Martinez debuted one year after the Pedro Martinez you are sure to know?—and that variations existed in spelling (AJ Burnett vs. A.J. Burnett as an example), this process was not as easy as it may sound.\nAt the time I was working on this, I had yet to discover the fuzzyjoin package or put two and two together that I could join these datasets together based on inexact matching. This wouldn’t have made the process a breeze, but it would have significantly simplified it.\nAt least on the bright side, I got the opportunity to work with the stringr package doing character string manipulation like fixing spelling, punctuation, and capitalization differences in player names. I also used some functions from the lubridate package to make sure dates were formatted uniformly. One example of many passes of manipulations is shown below.\n\n# changing two misspellings (fun players!): Carlos Gonzales(z), Miguel Teje(a)da\n# changing all caps TEAM to Team\n# changing YEAR (numeric class) to year with date (date class)\ntop_prospect_rankings &lt;- top_prospect_rankings %&gt;%\n  mutate(\"PLAYER_NAME\" = str_replace(PLAYER_NAME, \"Carlos Gonzales\", \n                                    \"Carlos Gonzalez\"),\n         \"PLAYER_NAME\" = str_replace(PLAYER_NAME, \"Miguel Tejeda\",\n                                     \"Miguel Tejada\"),\n         \"TEAM\" = str_to_title(top_prospect_rankings$TEAM),\n         \"YEAR\" = lubridate::ymd(YEAR, truncated = 2))"

    "text": "9.4 Data Transformation\n\ndplyr package\nBy far and away, my favorite and most-used package was dplyr. The name is meant to mean “d” for data and the “plyr” for plier, as in manipulating data with a tool like a plier. Even in the example above, mutate is a function from the dplyr package. Any data analyst working in R is almost certain to utilize dplyr.\nIn a large sense, I took data out of the play-by-play dataset and moved it into a flat summary table with one row summarizing each player. dplyr made this possible. One of my most crucial steps was to convert the wOBA value for every plate appearance for every batter or batter faced for every pitcher into a “rolling wOBA” or “rolling wOBA against” data column. This took the cumulative wOBA or wOBA against for a player up to that specific plate appearance or batter faced in their career. It enabled me to determine what a batter’s wOBA was at 150 plate appearances or a pitcher’s wOBA against at 860 batters faced as an example. The code below uses dplyr functions I used over and over—group_by, filter, mutate, relocate, ungroup—and also some base R functions—cumsum and seq_along.\n\n# calculate rolling wOBA for batters\nbat_wOBA_log_debut_1990_on &lt;- career_wOBA_log_w_biodates %&gt;%\n  group_by(BAT_ID) %&gt;%\n  filter(BAT_DEBUT &gt; \"1990-04-08\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(ROLLING_WOBA_BAT = cumsum(EVENT_WOBA) / seq_along(EVENT_WOBA)) %&gt;%\n  relocate(ROLLING_WOBA_BAT, .after = CAREER_PA_WOBA_NUM) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nMy understanding is that dplyr is very similar to SQL (structured query language). It enables you to do SQL-like queries like this one which combed through 71,080 baseball games to find games that ended in back-to-back home runs. This was probably the most fun code I wrote!\n\nback_to_back_home_run_game_endings &lt;- game_data %&gt;% \n  select(row_idx, GAME_ID, PARK, DATE, HOME_TEAM_ID, AWAY_TEAM_ID, INNING, \n         BAT_NAME, PIT_NAME, EVENT_TX, HIT_VAL, EVENT_RUNS, PA_IND) %&gt;% ## focus on only these columns\n  arrange(ymd(DATE), row_idx) %&gt;% ## arrange sequentially by date and order of events\n  filter(PA_IND = TRUE) %&gt;% ## filter out non-plate appearance events\n  group_by(GAME_ID) %&gt;%\n  slice_tail(n = 2) %&gt;% ## select only the last two plate appearances of a game\n  filter(HIT_VAL == 4) %&gt;% ## filter for only home runs\n  group_by(GAME_ID) %&gt;% \n  add_count(GAME_ID) %&gt;% \n  filter(n != 1) %&gt;% ## filter for games with more than 1 home run in last two plate appearances\n  arrange(ymd(DATE), row_idx)\n\n\n\njanitor package\nAs amazing as dplyr is, it’s not meant for every single task. This is something I learned the hard way when trying to create cross-tabulations (think pivot tables if you’re more familiar with Excel) using a combination of dplyr functions. I stumbled across the janitor package, which has a function that in one line of code will create a crosstab for you—taybl. Janitor also has a number of data cleaning functions, hence the name.\nThe package also has the ability to enhance the crosstab by calculating totals and percentages within rows or columns. If you look back at my tables, this code becomes very evident. The two commas in the adorn_percentages function below might make no sense to you. They still don’t make much sense to me. It is essentially telling janitor to skip unused arguments. The Elite:DNQ is indicating to only calculate percentages for the Elite column through the DNQ column, not a “Total” column at the end, which I wanted to preserve with the numeric count.\n\n# create crosstabs for batters in a list, 150 plate appearances, by prospect rank\nbatter_woba_grade_crosstabs_150_list &lt;- all_batter_career_data_by_ID %&gt;% \n  filter(BAT_DEBUT &lt; \"2011-01-01\") %&gt;% \n  tabyl(FIRST_150_WOBA_GRADE, POST_150_WOBA_GRADE, PROSPECT_RANK_GROUP) %&gt;% \n  adorn_totals(c(\"row\", \"col\")) %&gt;% \n  adorn_percentages(\"row\",,Elite:DNQ)"

Good visualizations help simplify thousands or millions of data points into something understandable within 5 to 10 seconds. This is why packages for making different types of plots, graphs, charts, etc., like the ggplot2 package are so popular. All of my plots were done with the ggplot2 package.\nAs an extension of ggplot2, the ggpmisc package includes helpful functions like stat_correlation, which calculates the correlation values and annotates the plot with those values.\nAdditionally, I used the ipsum theme from the hrbrthemes package for all plots, which in my opinion is a major upgrade to the standard themes ggplot2 provides. The ipsum theme is as simple as loading the package and adding one line of code! Some of the additional themes through the package may require downloading specific fonts.\n\n# plot first 300 & post 300 PA for batters, add correlation, linear model\nall_batter_career_data_by_ID %&gt;%\n  filter(BAT_DEBUT &lt;  \"2011-01-01\" & CAREER_TOTAL_PA &gt;= 1800) %&gt;%\n1  ggplot(aes(x = POST_300_WOBA, y = FIRST_300_WOBA)) +\n2  geom_point(aes(color = PROSPECT_RANK_GROUP)) +\n3  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n4  stat_correlation(use_label(c(\"R\", \"R2\", \"P\"))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = signs::signs_format(accuracy = .001, \n                                                  trim_leading_zeros = TRUE)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = signs::signs_format(accuracy = .001, \n                                                  trim_leading_zeros = TRUE)) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#1192e8\", \n                                \"#fa4d56\", \n                                \"#002d9c\", \n                                \"#009d9a\", \n                                \"#a56eff\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Linear Correlation in wOBA for First & Post 300 PAs\", \n       subtitle = \"Includes All Batters...\") + \n  xlab(label = \"Post 300 PA wOBA\") + \n  ylab(label = \"First 300 PA wOBA\") + \n  guides(\n    color = \n      guide_legend(\n        title = \"Prospect Rank Group\")) + \n  theme_ipsum() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n1\n\nDefine x and y values.\n\n2\n\nDefine desired plot type (point for scatterplot).\n\n3\n\nOptional: Add another plot to the existing plot (linear model).\n\n4\n\nAnnotate the plot with these specific statistics."

My favorite thing about Quarto is that hardly any customization is needed for it to look aesthetic. The three things that required me to do a bit more digging were:\n\nLoading Packages & Data\nI assumed since I had already loaded the packages and data I was using in RStudio that I did not need to load them in my different Quarto files (.qmd files), which together comprise the Quarto Book. After some head-scratching and Googling, I learned that I did need to load them again. Each page of this website (Quarto book) is its own qmd file, so I repeated similar code below in each. I didn’t find a way to specify this globally so that it wouldn’t have to be repeated in each file, but I’m sure there is a way.\n\n# load necessary packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(hrbrthemes)\n\n\n# load necessary data\nload(\"crosstabs.RData\")\nload(\"summary_tables.RData\")\n\n\n\nExecution Options\nSince this project was more data journalism than scientific publishing, it wasn’t necessary for me to bog it down with chunk after chunk of code. This execution option specified in the .yml (master) file of the Quarto project essentially tells Quarto to run the code but not to include the code itself in the output. This can be overridden manually for specific code chunks with echo: true, which is how you are seeing code on this page.\n\nexecute:\n  echo: false\n\n\n\nPanel Tabsets\nIf my project wasn’t already unreadable on its own merits, it would have been far more so without the functionality of panel tabsets. I used these to give you as the reader the ability to toggle between visualizations, for example between charts focused on 150 plate appearances versus 600 plate appearances. These are extremely easy to add with the following code. The ::: panel-tabset and ::: enclose the panel, and the ## serve as the different headers for each tab.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n## 150 PA\n\ncode...\n\n## 600 PA\n\ncode...\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nGitHub\nI chose GitHub Pages to “host” my Quarto Book. If you look at the URL, this is apparent. For full transparency, I probably could not repeat this without re-referencing a tutorial. I believe this was the most helpful resource I found or the one that made the most sense to me."

The first is when they reach the maximum at-bats or innings pitched at which they are no longer considered prospects, and thus must be moved to your major league roster, traded, or cut. I recognize this point varies depending on different league settings. The second is more arbitrary, but I think it is common for managers to hold their prospects for at least a full season. As fans too, we generally say things like, “He’s still only a rookie.”\nWith that said, I’ve focused on comparing both:\n\nA batter’s first 150 Plate Appearances (PA) (roughly equal to 130 At-Bats) and pitcher’s first 215 Batters Faced (BF) (roughly equal to 50 Innings Pitched) with their remaining career statistics, as this is when players officially lose rookie eligibility\nA batter’s first 600 Plate Appearances and pitcher’s first 860 Batters Faced (roughly equal to 200 Innings Pitched) with their remaining career statistics, as this is fairly equivalent to a full season\n\nI realize 200 innings pitched is a bit high, but I wanted to keep the proportionality consistent between batters and pitchers (150 PA * 4 = 600 PA and 215 BF * 4 = 860 BF). Also, pitchers threw more innings in the past than they do now.\n\n\nBottom line: we need to isolate a player’s statistics up to these specific points and then compare it with their statistics after that point to determine the relationship between them."

I would be remiss if I did not plug subscribing to Baseball America and supporting their work if you have the means to do so.\nBecause dynasty managers are so often making decisions based on a player’s prospect pedigree—perhaps to an even greater degree than based on a player’s initial statistics over a small sample size—I thought it necessary to also include these rankings.

    "text": "2.6 Limitations\nAll research projects have limitations, so let’s get my dirty laundry out in the open!\nThe biggest limitation is that some active players who had yet to finish their career are included in the dataset of players. Note that the stats in the dataset only go through the 2020 season, and we are including all players who debuted from 1990-2010. I made the trade-off to include those players who debuted closer to the end of that period and were still active after 2020 because I reasoned that a bigger sample size of players would enhance the analysis more than abiding by a strict rule that all players must have finished their career by then. Assuming a player debuted as late as 2010, I felt that 2011 through 2020 was a large enough amount of time for them to compile meaningful career statistics.\nThe number of batters included in this analysis is 1,891 with 52 of them still active after the 2020 season. The number of pitchers is 717 with 30 of them still active after 2020.\nThe second limitation is that we are using a single statistic, wOBA (wOBA against or wOBA allowed for pitchers), for all our evaluation. We’ll talk more about why this is a limitation, but I will note here that Baseball America’s Top 100 Prospect rankings are intended to measure a player’s complete value (not solely offensive, etc.). A much better assessment of their rankings would be performed with WAR, which many outlets have done. Nowadays, there are fantasy-specific prospect rankings, which I would have used had they existed for this time period.\nI will address other limitations throughout the analysis."

    "text": "3.3 Additional wOBA Limitations\nBecause wOBA is an offensive statistic, there are limitations to using it to evaluate pitchers. This article lends great insight into that (also relevant for batters). Especially because we are looking at historical data—well before Statcast existed and Stuff+ models were created—our options for picking a stat for pitchers are limited. An issue with wOBA Against is that it betrays a concept important to advanced statistics like FIP (Fielding Independent Pitching). FIP isolates a pitcher’s performance from their defense behind them, which is considered out of their control.\nThis all may seem like a massive rabbit hole, but we’ll find ourselves below ground again at the very end, so it’s important to acknowledge the tunnels beneath us.\nOn a much simpler note, wOBA Against (or wOBA Allowed) has going for it that the top six pitchers from this dataset are Clayton Kershaw, Pedro Martinez, Chris Sale, Stephen Strasburg, Max Scherzer, and Justin Verlander. We shouldn’t overthink the fact that measuring how poorly batters perform against a pitcher over a long period of time is probably a relatively good indicator of how good the pitcher is. It’s not perfect, but it will suffice.\nA second limitation is that wOBA is not directly equivalent with fantasy baseball value. While fantasy leagues almost always include batting stats like Runs, Home Runs, RBIs, Stolen Bases, and either Batting Average or On-Base Percentage, wOBA does not explicitly factor in three of these stats (Runs, RBI, and Stolen Bases). My understanding is that the principle of wOBA—and sabermetrics as a whole—is to more accurately isolate a player’s value from situations outside of their control. Additionally, over longer periods of time batters with good wOBAs should generally wind up in better spots in the batting order, and counting stats like Runs and RBIs should follow. On the contrary, a good or bad wOBA will likely have little bearing on whether a player steals bases or not. The value a player contributes in this fantasy category is not captured in this analysis."

Did Not Qualify (DNQ) captures “cup of coffee” players, meaning that they only were in the major leagues for a very short time—enough for a cup of coffee but nothing more. I’ve noted in the Data Details section below the thresholds a player failed to reach to be classified as Did Not Qualify in addition to other important details and reminders.\nAs an example of using the charts, start at the Y axis with Good, and then look to your right. As you can see for the 150 PA chart, about 17% (8% + 5% + 4%)—note that percentages are rounded—of all batters hit for a Good wOBA for their first 150 plate appearances. Looking at the colors however, we can see that of those 17% of batters, 8% of them had a Bad wOBA after that point for the rest of their career (or failed to reach minimum plate appearance thresholds), 5% had an Average wOBA, and just 4% of them continued to have a Good wOBA.\nIf you toggle from 150 PA to 600 PA, you can see what these percentages are at 600 plate appearances and after. Colors without a labeled percentage are less than 3.5%—too small to label properly."

Ranked prospects outperform unranked prospects. That should come as no surprise to anyone.\nPercentages were left off these charts for sake of space and because we’ll look at these percentages in greater detail later.\nIt’s hugely important for us to acknowledge that the observations we made earlier when looking at all batters remain true only when looking at unranked prospects. You probably already sensed this, but a majority of batters are unranked prospects. They weight heavily in the chart that shows all batters together, making it hard to see the effect of top ranked prospects.\nThis underscores the importance of prospect pedigree in our analysis and the general principle of comparing subgroups of a dataset."

This will be helpful as we look at more detailed wOBA grades and the corresponding percentages of players.\nSome last things to mention for these charts:\n\nThe pitcher charts look visually similar to the batter charts (further analysis will help us more easily compare them).\nWe see similar differences in ranked prospects compared to unranked for both batters and pitchers, further emphasizing the importance of prospect pedigree.\nMore players had an Average wOBA or wOBA Against grade at 600 PA or 860 BF compared to 150 PA or 215 BF, which suggests that more extreme outcomes become less likely over time.\nTop 25 prospects were pretty darn good.

    "text": "4.4 Answering the Riddle\nI hope the tables are clear enough for you to answer the riddle! For the riddle purists out there who are screaming that this was a question, I am asking you to allow me some alliteration.\nWith regard to Jones, there were 105 batters who were Unranked prospects with a wOBA grade of Good for their first 600 plate appearances. Only 2% improved their wOBA grade to Great, 17% remained Good, 30% declined to Average, 20% Below Average or Poor, and 30% Did Not Qualify, meaning that they did not last more than two more full seasons in the major leagues (approximately 1200 more plate appearances)—1800 total career plate appearances.\nSince Jones was a borderline top 100 prospect, it might make sense to also reference the table for batters who had a prospect rank of 76 - 100. Even if we look at those prospects who began their career with a Good wOBA, a higher percentage of them had a worse wOBA grade for the remainder of their career (58%).\nFor Tovar, eleven top 25 prospects began their career with a Poor wOBA over their first 600 plate appearances. Five of them (45%) improved to have a Good wOBA for the remainder of their career, four (36%) to an Average wOBA, and two (18%) remained Poor."

Unranked prospects as a group essentially show no improvement.\nAdditionally, a much higher percentage of ranked prospects stay in the majors for at least 1,800 plate appearances compared to unranked prospects (94% at the high end to 55% for unranked prospects).\nAs for comparisons between ranked prospects, prospects ranked 1 - 25 and 26 - 50 are quite similar while there is a noticeable difference between them and prospects ranked 51 - 100.\nAs a whole, prospects ranked 1 - 50 just make the leap from an Average wOBA grade to Good wOBA grade based on their first/post 600 plate appearances. Prospects ranked 51 - 100 make the leap from a Poor or Below Average wOBA grade to Average based on their first/post 150 plate appearances."

This is about ten batters each year on average. Seven of those ten were batters who were top 100 prospects. Three of them were unranked prospects."

What would the best case scenario have been for you?\nImportant notes for these lists:\n\nThese prospects ranks are from Baseball America.\nCareer wOBA is as of the end of the 2020 season.

I suspect there could be some healthy debate in comparing and contrasting these lists. After looking at these lists, the limitations I mentioned at the beginning become more apparent. Namely, wOBA does not fully capture a player’s value, especially in the context of fantasy.\nHaving said that, the contrast between top ranked prospects and top unranked prospects seems stark in my eyes. The best you could have hoped for from the unranked prospect pool was probably Robinson Cano, Jeff Kent, Jason Giambi, Matt Holliday, Jim Edmonds, Brian Giles…\nNotable fantasy impact players are far more plentiful among ranked prospects. This is no surprise, but the degree of contrast may be surprising.\nYou may be interested in the median and mean prospect rank for the batting prospects on the ranked list (an even set of numbers): median of 21.5, mean of 31."

Santana was the pitcher with the most improvement from his first roughly 50 innings pitched to the remainder of his career. His wOBA Against was .417 after 215 batters faced and decreased all the way to .287.\nBeyond Santana, Webb, Hudson, Wainwright, and Buehrle stick out to me. Rich Hill being so high is a surprise and also touches on another previously mentioned limitation that some active players are still included. His wOBA Against has certainly jumped since 2020.\nWhat becomes more apparent in comparing and contrasting these lists is that longevity is not explicitly included here. For instance, I’d never heard of Francisco Cordova. He only pitched five seasons—four full ones—for the Pirates in the late 90s/2000.\nIf we do some very rough math, ranked pitching prospects faced 404,128 batters while unranked prospects faced 335,758 in total. Sticking with our estimated ratio of 50 innings pitched per every 215 batters faced, those numbers translate to roughly 94,000 innings for ranked pitching prospects and 78,100 innings for unranked pitching prospects—a 16,000 inning difference, 320 more innings for each ranked pitching prospect on average compared to unranked.\nWhile the ratio of unranked pitching prospects compared to ranked pitching prospects with Good career wOBA Against grades or better is higher than the corresponding ratio for batters, the top 50 unranked pitchers are not making me believe that unranked pitching prospects are a better investment than unranked batting prospects. Like I said before, this is certainly a bit subjective and could be a good debate, but that’s my assessment.\nThe median and mean prospect rank for pitching prospects on the ranked list: median of 21.5, mean of 34.4."

For example, the points in the 900 PA plot are on average much closer to the line compared to the 150 PA plot. This means that there is a stronger relationship between batters’ first 900 PA wOBA and their post 900 PA wOBA compared to the relationship between batters’ first 150 PA wOBA and post 150 PA wOBA. That’s straightforward enough.\nIt’s evident that the more plate appearances, the stronger the relationship becomes as shown by the gradual increase in R: .26 (a weak relationship) to .37 to .44 to .5 to .6 (a moderate relationship, bordering strong).\nRelated to this, initial wOBA becomes better at predicting a batter’s post wOBA as the number of plate appearances increases. R2 measures this precisely. As an example, when R2 = .07 for the 150 PA plot, this means that initial wOBA is only able to explain 7% of the variation in post wOBA. Other factors are explaining the remaining 93%.\nThat means that if we were going to add a new batter (point) to the plot but only knew their first 150 PA wOBA, the line would be almost useless in helping us determine where to draw the point (predicting the batter’s post 150 PA wOBA).\nThe fact that this R2 number is so low hammers home the idea of sample size. We simply do not know much about a batter after 150 plate appearances even if we think we do. R2 steadily rises from .07 to .14 to .19 to .25 to .35 at 900 plate appearances, but even at 900 PA, only 35% of the variation in post wOBA is explained by initial wOBA.\nYou may be thinking, “Well, how long do we have to wait to become confident in our evaluation of a player based on their initial performance?”\nIf you are purely basing your evaluation on wOBA, I don’t think waiting much longer than 900 plate appearances will significantly increase your confidence level, meaning that an R value of .6 and R2 value of .35 will not go much higher. Matt Klaassen at FanGraphs has some relevant research on this over a larger number of seasons and players that aligns closely with these numbers."

Even without Statcast data, we would still have advanced stats like FIP and xFIP, which help isolate pitcher performance from the performance of their defense, which is largely outside of their control.\nThis piece by Thomas Nestico is a fantastic overview of these concepts and also includes season comparisons between ERA, xFIP, and tjStuff+ with R and R2 values. Alex Chamberlain over at FanGraphs also has a wonderful three-part series on ERA estimators (1, 2, 3). Both are trying to find a method for better predicting future pitching success.\nThe vast amount of research on pitching and its rapid growth makes me feel unqualified to make any conclusive statements about interpreting these results. I suspect there is a mix of both contributing factors. 1) Pitchers are less predictable than batters. 2) We could find a better stat than wOBA Against to use in a simple linear regression (not to mention a more advanced regression model with multiple predictors)."

This dataset was separate from the primary dataset that included all player statistics and game data, so I had to figure out a way to join them together in order to link player statistics and player prospect ranks.\nBecause the prospect dataset did not include unique player IDs, I was forced to join them together based on player names. Given that multiple players have the same names—for instance, did you know that a second Pedro Martinez debuted one year after the Pedro Martinez you are sure to know?—and that variations existed in spelling (AJ Burnett vs. A.J. Burnett as an example), this process was not as easy as it may sound.\nAt the time I was working on this, I had yet to discover the fuzzyjoin package or put two and two together that I could join these datasets together based on inexact matching. This wouldn’t have made the process a breeze, but it would have significantly simplified it.\nAt least on the bright side, I got the opportunity to work with the stringr package doing character string manipulation like fixing spelling, punctuation, and capitalization differences in player names. I also used some functions from the lubridate package to make sure dates were formatted uniformly. One example of many passes of manipulations is shown below.\n\n# changing two misspellings (fun players!): Carlos Gonzales(z), Miguel Teje(a)da\n# changing all caps TEAM to Team\n# changing YEAR (numeric class) to year with date (date class)\ntop_prospect_rankings &lt;- top_prospect_rankings %&gt;%\n  mutate(\"PLAYER_NAME\" = str_replace(PLAYER_NAME, \"Carlos Gonzales\", \n                                    \"Carlos Gonzalez\"),\n         \"PLAYER_NAME\" = str_replace(PLAYER_NAME, \"Miguel Tejeda\",\n                                     \"Miguel Tejada\"),\n         \"TEAM\" = str_to_title(top_prospect_rankings$TEAM),\n         \"YEAR\" = lubridate::ymd(YEAR, truncated = 2))"

The name is meant to mean “d” for data and the “plyr” for plier, as in manipulating data with a tool like a plier. Even in the example above, mutate is a function from the dplyr package. Any data analyst working in R is almost certain to utilize dplyr.\nIn a large sense, I took data out of the play-by-play dataset and moved it into a flat summary table with one row summarizing each player. dplyr made this possible. One of my most crucial steps was to convert the wOBA value for every plate appearance for every batter or batter faced for every pitcher into a “rolling wOBA” or “rolling wOBA against” data column. This took the cumulative wOBA or wOBA against for a player up to that specific plate appearance or batter faced in their career. It enabled me to determine what a batter’s wOBA was at 150 plate appearances or a pitcher’s wOBA against at 860 batters faced as an example. The code below uses dplyr functions I used over and over—group_by, filter, mutate, relocate, ungroup—and also some base R functions—cumsum and seq_along.\n\n# calculate rolling wOBA for batters\nbat_wOBA_log_debut_1990_on &lt;- career_wOBA_log_w_biodates %&gt;%\n  group_by(BAT_ID) %&gt;%\n  filter(BAT_DEBUT &gt; \"1990-04-08\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(ROLLING_WOBA_BAT = cumsum(EVENT_WOBA) / seq_along(EVENT_WOBA)) %&gt;%\n  relocate(ROLLING_WOBA_BAT, .after = CAREER_PA_WOBA_NUM) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nMy understanding is that dplyr is very similar to SQL (structured query language). It enables you to do SQL-like queries like this one which combed through 71,080 baseball games to find games that ended in back-to-back home runs. This was probably the most fun code I wrote!\n\nback_to_back_home_run_game_endings &lt;- game_data %&gt;% \n  select(row_idx, GAME_ID, PARK, DATE, HOME_TEAM_ID, AWAY_TEAM_ID, INNING, \n         BAT_NAME, PIT_NAME, EVENT_TX, HIT_VAL, EVENT_RUNS, PA_IND) %&gt;% ## focus on only these columns\n  arrange(ymd(DATE), row_idx) %&gt;% ## arrange sequentially by date and order of events\n  filter(PA_IND = TRUE) %&gt;% ## filter out non-plate appearance events\n  group_by(GAME_ID) %&gt;%\n  slice_tail(n = 2) %&gt;% ## select only the last two plate appearances of a game\n  filter(HIT_VAL == 4) %&gt;% ## filter for only home runs\n  group_by(GAME_ID) %&gt;% \n  add_count(GAME_ID) %&gt;% \n  filter(n != 1) %&gt;% ## filter for games with more than 1 home run in last two plate appearances\n  arrange(ymd(DATE), row_idx)\n\n\n\njanitor package\nAs amazing as dplyr is, it’s not meant for every single task. This is something I learned the hard way when trying to create cross-tabulations (think pivot tables if you’re more familiar with Excel) using a combination of dplyr functions. I stumbled across the janitor package, which has a function that in one line of code will create a crosstab for you—taybl. Janitor also has a number of data cleaning functions, hence the name.\nThe package also has the ability to enhance the crosstab by calculating totals and percentages within rows or columns. If you look back at my tables, this code becomes very evident. The two commas in the adorn_percentages function below might make no sense to you. They still don’t make much sense to me. It is essentially telling janitor to skip unused arguments. The Elite:DNQ is indicating to only calculate percentages for the Elite column through the DNQ column, not a “Total” column at the end, which I wanted to preserve with the numeric count.\n\n# create crosstabs for batters in a list, 150 plate appearances, by prospect rank\nbatter_woba_grade_crosstabs_150_list &lt;- all_batter_career_data_by_ID %&gt;% \n  filter(BAT_DEBUT &lt; \"2011-01-01\") %&gt;% \n  tabyl(FIRST_150_WOBA_GRADE, POST_150_WOBA_GRADE, PROSPECT_RANK_GROUP) %&gt;% \n  adorn_totals(c(\"row\", \"col\")) %&gt;% \n  adorn_percentages(\"row\",,Elite:DNQ)"

Good visualizations can help simplify thousands or millions of data points into something understandable within 5 to 10 seconds. This is why packages for making different types of plots, graphs, charts, etc., like the ggplot2 package are so popular. All of my plots were done with the ggplot2 package.\nAs an extension of ggplot2, the ggpmisc package includes helpful functions like stat_correlation, which calculates the correlation values and annotates the plot with those values.\nAdditionally, I used the ipsum theme from the hrbrthemes package for all plots, which in my opinion is a major upgrade to the standard themes ggplot2 provides. The ipsum theme is as simple as loading the package and adding one line of code! Some of the additional themes through the package may require downloading specific fonts.\n\n# create scatterplot with correlation between first 300 & post 300 PA for batters\nall_batter_career_data_by_ID %&gt;%\n  filter(BAT_DEBUT &lt;  \"2011-01-01\" & CAREER_TOTAL_PA &gt;= 1800) %&gt;%\n1  ggplot(aes(x = POST_300_WOBA, y = FIRST_300_WOBA)) +\n2  geom_point(aes(color = PROSPECT_RANK_GROUP)) +\n3  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n4  stat_correlation(use_label(c(\"R\", \"R2\", \"P\"))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = signs::signs_format(accuracy = .001, \n                                                  trim_leading_zeros = TRUE)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = signs::signs_format(accuracy = .001, \n                                                  trim_leading_zeros = TRUE)) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#1192e8\", \n                                \"#fa4d56\", \n                                \"#002d9c\", \n                                \"#009d9a\", \n                                \"#a56eff\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Linear Correlation in wOBA for First & Post 300 PAs\", \n       subtitle = \"Includes All Batters with At Least 1800 Career Plate Appearances\") + \n  xlab(label = \"Post 300 PA wOBA\") + \n  ylab(label = \"First 300 PA wOBA\") + \n  guides(\n    color = \n      guide_legend(\n        title = \"Prospect Rank Group\")) + \n  theme_ipsum() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n1\n\nDefine x and y values.\n\n2\n\nDefine desired plot type (point for scatterplot).\n\n3\n\nOptional: Add another plot to the existing plot (a line showing linear correlation).\n\n4\n\nAnnotate the plot with these specific statistics."

My favorite thing about Quarto is that hardly any customization is needed for it to look aesthetic. The three things that required me to do a bit more digging were:\n\nLoading Packages & Data\nI assumed since I had already loaded the packages and data I was using in RStudio that I did not need to load them in my different Quarto files (.qmd files) which together comprise the Quarto Book. After some head-scratching and Googling, I learned that I did need to load them again. Each page of this website (Quarto book) is its own qmd file, so I repeated similar code below in each. I didn’t find a way to specify this globally so that it wouldn’t have to be repeated in each file, but I’m sure there is a way.\n\n# load necessary packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(hrbrthemes)\n\n\n# load necessary data\nload(\"crosstabs.RData\")\nload(\"summary_tables.RData\")\n\n\n\nExecution Options\nSince this project was more data journalism than scientific publishing, it wasn’t necessary for me to bog it down with chunk after chunk of code. This execution option specified in the .yml (master) file of the Quarto project essentially tells Quarto to run the code but not include the code itself in the output. This can be overrided manually for specific code chunks with echo: true, which is how you are seeing code on this page.\n\nexecute:\n  echo: false\n\n\n\nPanel Tabsets\nIf my project wasn’t already unreadable on its own merits, it would have been far more so without the functionality of panel tabsets. I used these to give you as the reader the ability to toggle between visualizations, for example between charts focused on 150 plate appearances versus 600 plate appearances. These are extremely easy to add with the following code. The ::: panel-tabset and ::: enclose the panel, and the ## serve as the different headers for each tab.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n## 150 PA\n\ncode...\n\n## 600 PA\n\ncode...\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nGitHub\nI chose GitHub Pages to “host” my Quarto Book. If you look at the URL, this is apparent. For full transparency, I probably could not repeat this without re-referencing a tutorial. I believe this was the most helpful resource I found or the one that made the most sense to me."

They have some default projects you can pick, but I definitely wanted to do something of greater interest to me to help stay motivated.\nI found the program to be a fantastic intro-level course on data analytics and key tools. From there, I felt more confident to branch out into more specific areas and tools that I had yet to work with. Since I love the big picture, I found their breakdown of the data analysis process extremely insightful. This was my north star throughout my project.\n\nAsk\nPrepare\nProcess\nAnalyze\nShare\nAct\n\n\n\nStack Overflow\nWhen I first started my project, the only code examples I had were from the Google Analytics Certificate program. As I plodded along, there were hundreds of times where I knew what end result I wanted (for example, a new column of data) but didn’t know what code to write to get there. Stack Overflow was enormously helpful in getting closer to the specific code I needed as long as I could formulate a question that was in the ballpark of what I was looking for. Of the hundreds of questions I had, I only wound up having to ask a minor one where I couldn’t find an existing answer. That’s quite a testament to the amount of information available and incredible credit to the individuals who provide answers. Where do you they find the time?!\nI recognize that AI tools may have reached the point of being a more efficient tool than combing through sites like Stack Overflow. When I first started my project, I don’t think Chat-GPT or other similar tools had quite caught on like they have today. It may have been a poor decision, but I decided that I wasn’t going to use AI tools for this project. This was primarily because I felt like having to struggle a bit, figure things out more manually, etc., would help me acquire a better understanding of the concepts than having code more auto-generated. I also felt like I wouldn’t be able to properly validate if the AI-generated solutions had errors or not.\n\n\nFunction Reference for Packages\nFor all the packages I used, the function reference/reference manual was enormously helpful to get my code to work and accomplish the goals of my project. Here is the manual for dplyr as an example.\nIf you click on a specific function, it tells you what exactly must and can be included (referred to as arguments). They also provide examples, which I found even more helpful.\nIf I could go back, I would probably read beforehand through the different functions in dplyr and the other core packages I used, as I had times where I stumbled upon a function too late—add_count() is one example. It’s hard to know all the functions you need beforehand, but especially for dplyr, this would have made my life easier.\nFrom the package website, there is typically a link to GitHub, which has an “Issues” tab that can be helpful if you feel like something isn’t working exactly as expected—gt package example.\n\n\nPackage Cheatsheets\nI believe that the ggplot2 package is one of the most downloaded packages from R’s package repository. With that, I suspect it is also one of the most popular cheatsheets. While the function reference gets to a more helpful level of detail, these cheatsheets provide a bird’s eye everything a package can do. The ggplot2 cheatsheet is great because it gives you a sense of all the data visualizations that are possible and the different components of plots. Not every package has a cheatsheet, but it’s a must-use when available.\n\n\nR for the Rest of Us\nI’m not sure where I first heard about R for the Rest of Us, but I can’t recommend them enough. I’ve yet to take any of their full courses and didn’t do their R in 3 Months despite strongly considering it, but even signing up for their emails, listening to their podcast, and watching their shorter YouTube videos has been a huge help. From learning of new packages to making visualizations look prettier to improving workflows, they have so much to offer. The best part about it is that they gear themselves towards folks with a non-coding background.\n\n\nYouTube\nSome channels I found helpful included Riffomonas Project, Equitable Equations, and Posit PBC—particularly Quarto-specific videos. On the statistics side of things, I joined the StatQuest throng to make sure my statistics knowledge was not erroneous and also referenced Marin Stats Lectures."

    "section": "11.1 General Reflections",
    "text": "11.1 General Reflections\n\nProject-Based Learning\nOne of the most constant refrains of advice I keep hearing for growing your skills in data analytics is to do projects. I wholeheartedly agree.\nThere are a number of reasons why doing projects is such an effective way to learn. The two that stand out the most to me are 1) repetition and 2) being forced to simultaneously and continuously stretch between executing a big idea that will provide value to others while attending to extremely small details. The first is self-explanatory, particularly as it relates to coding, but cannot be emphasized enough. The second is a constant challenge, but it captures the beauty of data analytics, in that when you are pulling your hair out over a detail that is 1/1000th of your whole project, you know that ultimately all of those small details weave together into something significant that will tangibly help others.\n\n\nSolving Problems, Answering Crucial Questions\nWell, at least that’s the idea—to tangibly help others. Unfortunately, it can be easy to slip into data analysis done solely for the act of analyzing data or to ascertain something more trivial. For non-baseball fans, this whole project could be categorized as such, but I hope that those of you who are diehard baseball and fantasy baseball fans derived some value from it.\nToeing the fine line between valuable and trivial analysis has reinforced for me that the purpose of data analytics is to help solve real problems and answer crucial questions, not to analyze data—as counter-intuitive as that sounds. Analyzing data is a means to a greater end. With that in mind, the most vital element of data analytics is arguably uncovering the most important questions.\n\n\nDomain Knowledge\nWhat helped me arrive at a good question (at least in my opinion) is that I myself was the audience, the end-user, the decision-maker. I root for Nolan Jones and Ezequiel Tovar as a Rockies fan and make regular, difficult (relatively speaking) decisions as a dynasty fantasy baseball manager to keep or cut/trade players.\nThis idea speaks to another constant refrain I hear in the data space: that at least some understanding of the domain/subject/business will make you a better data analyst. In my day jobs, I’ve experienced this to an even greater extent. Knowing the goals of different nonprofit and government programs that I’ve worked with has helped me quickly zero in on important questions, relevant data, and appropriate methods for analysis and reporting.\nGiven how overwhelming it feels to learn and keep up with the number of technical skills and tools needed in the data space, it’s encouraging to remember that domain knowledge, not to mention other related skills like communication, project management, working with people, is a significant facet of what makes an effective analyst.\n\n\nScope & Scope Creep\nIf I could give any advice to the me who was just about to embark on this project a year ago, it would be to simplify my research question and narrow the scope of my project. Multiple datasets (play-by-play and prospect ranks), multiple player types (batters and pitchers), multiple periods (150 and 600 plate appearances, 215 and 860 batters faced), multiple analyses (wOBA grades, percentage outcomes, numeric outcomes, linear correlation)… it simply became too much. This was primarily because I was also learning R while trying to achieve all of this. Had I already possessed the skills, I think it would have been a reasonable scope, but learning and doing it all at the same time was a lot.\nAdditionally, there were many lines of code that I wrote that went unused, analyses and visualizations that ultimately were superseded by what I felt were better analyses and visualizations. I think some of this is natural and also demonstrates that I was trying to convey the analysis in the clearest and most valuable way for you as the audience. However, in the future I need to be more vigilant to guard against scope creep. Better defining my research questions and project scope from the get-go should help with this.\n\n\nDon’t Be Afraid of Programming\nTo be honest, I’m still a bit afraid of coding. Learning a programming language like R is usually referred to as a steep learning curve, which is definitely true, but what is less mentioned is that even an intermediate grasp of one of them is extremely valuable. It’s not as if you have to reach the top of the curve to start drawing value from it. In my day job, incorporating R has given me the ability obtain and work with larger/more unwieldy datasets that would be extremely difficult if not impossible to do with no or low-coding tools. In my personal experience, it has been so worth the effort.\nThe tidyverse in particular includes fairly user-friendly packages with command language that is designed to be highly learnable for data scientists and analysts. This may be a bit naive of me and isn’t something I would necessarily recommend, but I think an argument can be made that even only learning dplyr could be a value-add.\n\n\nR & the R Community are Amazing\nI’m sure other programming languages like Python are also amazing, but the R community regularly receives praise for being highly supportive and inclusive. I’ve found that to be accurate from observing people generously answering questions on platforms like Stack Overflow; to putting out free resources, books, and workshops; to hosting local conferences and events; and perhaps most of all, developing packages that make coding easier and are free for anyone to use.\nIf you’re interested in data analytics and learning a programming language but have some natural trepidation, just know that there is a whole community of people who work diligently to make it accessible for all willing to make the effort."

Let’s enjoy this jewel of a GIF to help illustrate a more technical observation about my project.\nAt many points, I felt like I was attempting to do with my data what the St. Louis Cardinals were attempting to do with the baserunner, Jacoby Ellsbury, in this “rundown” / “pickle” in baseball terms. I was trying to write code to get the data into the format I needed but doing so in an inefficient way. In baseball, rundowns should generally take the fielding team two or three throws maximum to tag the runner out. Cleaning and wrangling data is similar.\nThe biggest example of this was when I was working with the prospect rank dataset that I mentioned previously. I’ll spare you the gory details, but reflecting back on it, I should have begun by writing down each issue with the data, identifying specific intermediate states for the data in addition to the end state, and doing further research on other possible ways to address the issues. By rushing into it, it actually took me far longer than it would have with more planning.\nIf anything, I’ll take this GIF with me as a helpful analogy for what to avoid in the future!\n\n\nCode Smells\nI can’t remember how I stumbled across this article, but I’m happy I did. I found it insightful despite a lack of proposed alternatives because it got my brain thinking about good and bad code, something I knew I would have to turn my attention towards eventually. For my project, I was not extremely concerned with inefficient code as long as it was not egregious because my main objective was to “get the job done” and figured I could improve my code over time.\nAs an example, you can see my case_when sins.\n\n# convert wOBA into wOBA grades\nall_batter_career_data_by_ID &lt;- all_batter_career_data_by_ID %&gt;%\n  mutate(FIRST_600_WOBA_GRADE = case_when(\n    FIRST_600_WOBA_GRADE == 0 ~ \"DNQ\",\n    FIRST_600_WOBA &gt;= .400 ~ \"Elite\",\n    between(FIRST_600_WOBA, .370, .399) ~ \"Great\",\n    between(FIRST_600_WOBA, .340, .369) ~ \"Good\",\n    between(FIRST_600_WOBA, .320, .339) ~ \"Average\",\n    between(FIRST_600_WOBA, .310, .319) ~ \"Below Average\",\n    between(FIRST_600_WOBA, .291, .309) ~ \"Poor\",\n    FIRST_600_WOBA &lt;= .290 ~ \"Awful\"),\n    FIRST_600_WOBA_GRADE = factor(FIRST_600_WOBA_GRADE, levels = \n                                  c(\"Elite\", \"Great\", \"Good\", \"Average\",\n                                    \"Below Average\", \"Poor\", \"Awful\", \"DNQ\")))\n\nEchoing the author of the post, I am not aware of a great alternative to this. This also makes intuitive sense to me. When the value is this, then make it ~ that. Regardless, code smells is a great concept for someone in my shoes who is now at the point of wanting to write much better code.\n\n\nCode Conciseness\nRelated to this is the idea of code conciseness. From what I gather, code should be as readable as possible and as concise as possible.\nI felt like my code was fairly readable—perhaps only because I added an excessive amount of comments every step of the way.\nAs for conciseness? Nope!\nFor example, look at this disaster if you are sick enough (viewer discretion advised). The first part of the code is just one of the many dataframes I created that you see in the second part of the code, and that wasn’t all of them.\n\n# calculate wOBA for each batter after 900 career plate appearances\npost_900_woba_bat &lt;- bat_wOBA_log_debut_1990_on_no_pit %&gt;%\n  group_by(BAT_ID) %&gt;%\n  filter(CAREER_PA_WOBA_NUM &gt; 900) %&gt;%\n  summarise(POST_900_WOBA = mean(EVENT_WOBA))\n\n# bring batter wOBA at different plate appearance totals into summary dataframe\nall_batter_career_data_by_ID &lt;- all_batter_career_data_by_ID %&gt;%\n  left_join(first_300_woba_bat, by = \"BAT_ID\") %&gt;%\n  left_join(first_450_woba_bat, by = \"BAT_ID\") %&gt;% \n  left_join(first_900_woba_bat, by = \"BAT_ID\") %&gt;% \n  left_join(post_300_woba_bat, by = \"BAT_ID\") %&gt;%\n  left_join(post_450_woba_bat, by = \"BAT_ID\") %&gt;% \n  left_join(post_900_woba_bat, by = \"BAT_ID\") \n\nA more efficient way to do this would have been:\n\nall_batter_career_data_by_ID &lt;- bat_wOBA_log_debut_1990_on_no_pit %&gt;%\n  group_by(BAT_ID) %&gt;% \n1  summarise(FIRST_300_WOBA = mean(EVENT_WOBA[CAREER_PA_WOBA_NUM &lt;= 300]),\n            FIRST_450_WOBA = mean(EVENT_WOBA[CAREER_PA_WOBA_NUM &lt;= 450]),\n            FIRST_900_WOBA = mean(EVENT_WOBA[CAREER_PA_WOBA_NUM &lt;= 900]),\n            POST_300_WOBA = mean(EVENT_WOBA[CAREER_PA_WOBA_NUM &gt; 300]), \n            POST_450_WOBA = mean(EVENT_WOBA[CAREER_PA_WOBA_NUM &gt; 450]),\n            POST_900_WOBA = mean(EVENT_WOBA[CAREER_PA_WOBA_NUM &gt; 900])) %&gt;% \n  left_join(all_batter_career_data_by_ID, \n2            .,\n3            by = \"BAT_ID\")\n\n\n1\n\nThe [ ] subsets the dataframe to only focus on rows where that condition is met.\n\n2\n\nThe . indicates the summary table generated by the group_by and summarise functions.\n\n3\n\nJoin the summary table to the all_batter_career_data_by_ID dataframe based on batter IDs.\n\n\n\n\nThis way calculates all the needed wOBA values in one shot and completely avoids creating intermediate objects that would have to be deleted later.\n\n\nFunctions & Iteration\nThe above code is a huge improvement, but I suspect it may be possible to do even better if we wrote a function or iterated in some way.\nHadley Wickham, the man who created the tidyverse packages that I used so much for this project, says that if you copy/paste code twice to write a function.\nThat sounds easy enough, right?\nWell, my initial foray into writing functions was a bit mystifying. I was able to successfully write a function to create a gt table theme, as I mentioned previously.\nI also wrote a function that I wound up not using—drawing insight from this post and another.\n\n# write function to reclassify wOBA grades to numbers\nwoba_grade_to_num_fn &lt;- function(x) {\n  case_when({{x}} == \"Elite\" ~ 8, \n            {{x}} == \"Great\" ~ 7,\n            {{x}} == \"Good\" ~ 6,\n            {{x}} == \"Average\" ~ 5,\n            {{x}} == \"Below Average\" ~ 4,\n            {{x}} == \"Poor\" ~ 3,\n            {{x}} == \"Awful\" ~ 2,\n            {{x}} == \"DNQ\" ~ 1)\n}\n\n# apply the function (example)\nmutate(across(c(FIRST_150_WOBA_GRADE, \n                POST_150_WOBA_GRADE, \n                FIRST_600_WOBA_GRADE,\n                POST_600_WOBA_GRADE), \n                ~ woba_grade_to_num_fn(.)))\n\nI also attempted to use the purrr package one or two times, but I didn’t get very far.\nAt the end of the day, I don’t feel too bad about not making much headway when it comes to functions and iteration since it is a bit more advanced, but I’m glad I got a taste and have direction in terms of what to learn/tackle next."

    "text": "11.3 Philosophical Reflections\nFor those of you who know me, you know that I never miss an opportunity to weave in something philosophical to whatever I have my hands on. You can be the judge of whether I stretched too far :)\n\nPessimistic Analytics\nI recently listened to an episode of the Analytics Power Hour where Kathleen Maley stated that 80% of analytics projects fail. Failure wasn’t defined as not completing a project but rather that it did not provide the business or organization value.\nWhile it was likely an illogical leap to apply this concept directly to my project, it’s a leap that my mind must have made somewhere along the way. I started to think that I had a 1 in 5 chance of succeeding. This was layered on top of learning a programming language, my project taking an extremely long time, and working alone. There were times when I thought what I was working on would never see the light of day. I felt a bit like Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) who epitomizes a philosophy of pessimism in the novel-based film Se7en (minute 2:37 to 3:35 in the clip below).\n\nEven having finished my project and reaching insights that seem actionable, I have yet to fully expel this sentiment. This line in particular lingers: “Even the most promising clues only lead to others.”\nSomething about the pursuit of knowledge—in analytics, the pursuit of actionable knowledge through data—has a way of leaving me pessimistic. The effect of our knowledge—even a great deal of knowledge—particularly on the most important areas in personal and communal life, feels so limited.\nAs much as I would like to be free of such thoughts, I think a small dose of pessimism may actually be helpful for me as an analyst."

    "text": "10.4 Data Transformation & Analysis\nNow for the exciting packages!\n\ndplyr package\nBy far and away, my favorite and most-used package was dplyr, an extremely popular package in the world of data analysis. The name is meant to mean “d” for data and the “plyr” for plier, as in manipulating data with a tool like a plier. Even in the code above, mutate is a function from the dplyr package.\nIn a large sense, I took data out of the play-by-play dataset and moved it into a flat summary table with one row containing statistics and other relevant data for each player. dplyr made this possible.\nOne of my most crucial steps was to convert the wOBA value for every plate appearance for every batter and pitcher into a “rolling wOBA” or “rolling wOBA Against” data column. This took the cumulative wOBA or wOBA Against for a player up to that specific plate appearance (or batter faced) in their career. It enabled me to determine what a batter’s wOBA was at 150 plate appearances or a pitcher’s wOBA Against at 860 batters faced as an example. The code below uses dplyr functions that I used over and over—group_by, filter, mutate, relocate, ungroup—and also some base R functions—cumsum and seq_along. ungroup is still a bit confusing to me!\n\n# calculate rolling wOBA for batters\nbat_wOBA_log_debut_1990_on &lt;- career_wOBA_log_w_biodates %&gt;%\n  group_by(BAT_ID) %&gt;%\n  filter(BAT_DEBUT &gt; \"1990-04-08\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(ROLLING_WOBA_BAT = cumsum(EVENT_WOBA) / seq_along(EVENT_WOBA)) %&gt;%\n  relocate(ROLLING_WOBA_BAT, .after = CAREER_PA_WOBA_NUM) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nMy understanding is that dplyr is very similar to SQL (structured query language). It enables you to do SQL-like queries like this one which combed through the 71,080 baseball games in the dataset to find which ones ended in back-to-back home runs. This was probably the most fun code I wrote!\n\nback_to_back_home_run_game_endings &lt;- game_data %&gt;% \n  select(row_idx, GAME_ID, PARK, DATE, HOME_TEAM_ID, AWAY_TEAM_ID, INNING, \n1         BAT_NAME, PIT_NAME, EVENT_TX, HIT_VAL, EVENT_RUNS, PA_IND) %&gt;%\n2  arrange(ymd(DATE), row_idx) %&gt;%\n3  filter(PA_IND = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  group_by(GAME_ID) %&gt;%\n4  slice_tail(n = 2) %&gt;%\n5  filter(HIT_VAL == 4) %&gt;%\n  group_by(GAME_ID) %&gt;% \n6  add_count(GAME_ID) %&gt;%\n7  filter(n != 1) %&gt;%\n  arrange(ymd(DATE), row_idx)\n\n\n1\n\nPick only these columns from the dataset.\n\n2\n\n%&gt;% is called the forward pipe operator, which essentially says, “Do this %&gt;% then do this.”\n\n3\n\nArrange sequentially by date and order of events within each game.\n\n4\n\nFilter out non-plate appearance events like stolen bases.\n\n5\n\nSelect only the last two plate appearances of each game.\n\n6\n\nFilter for only home runs (HR).\n\n7\n\nCount how many times the game ID appeared (zero (no HRs in last two PAs), once (one HR), or twice (bingo!)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\njanitor package\nAs amazing as dplyr is, it’s not the best tool for every single task. This is something I learned the hard way when trying to create cross-tabulations (think pivot tables if you’re more familiar with Excel) using a combination of dplyr functions. I stumbled across the janitor package, which has a function that in one line of code will create a crosstab for you—taybl. janitor also has a number of data cleaning functions, hence the name.\nThe package also has the ability to enhance crosstabs by calculating totals and percentages within rows or columns. If you look back at my tables, this code becomes very evident. The two commas in the adorn_percentages function below might make no sense to you. They still don’t make much sense to me and trigger a warning ⚠️ triangle in RStudio. It is telling janitor to skip unused arguments in the function. The Elite:DNQ is indicating to only calculate percentages for the Elite column through the DNQ column, not a “Total” column at the end, which I wanted to preserve with the numeric count.\n\n# create crosstabs for batters in a list, 150 plate appearances, by prospect rank\nbatter_woba_grade_crosstabs_150_list &lt;- all_batter_career_data_by_ID %&gt;% \n  filter(BAT_DEBUT &lt; \"2011-01-01\") %&gt;% \n  tabyl(FIRST_150_WOBA_GRADE, POST_150_WOBA_GRADE, PROSPECT_RANK_GROUP) %&gt;% \n  adorn_totals(c(\"row\", \"col\")) %&gt;% \n  adorn_percentages(\"row\",,Elite:DNQ)"

A good portion, although less than half (?)confirm, had a worse wOBA after their first 150 or 600 plate appearances. This can be deceiving (a batter with a .360 wOBA declining to a .350 wOBA for example versus a batter with a .284 wOBA improving to a .304 wOBA).\n\nNot only this, higher ranked prospects as a group improve more compared to unranked prospects.\nImprovement and regression"

    "text": "5.4 wOBA Against Grades - 860 BF\nOne piece that becomes evident quite quickly when looking at the percentage tables is that the number of pitchers represented is significantly less than the number of batters. Since we are focused only on starting pitchers, this cuts the number of pitchers down even further. With that said, you will see some grades that are entirely blank, meaning that no players had that initial wOBA Against grade.\nThe smaller “population” size also makes these tables less helpful. Many rows only include a few players, which doesn’t tell us much of anything.\n\n1 - 2526 - 5051 - 7576 - 100Unranked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n

    "text": "5.6 Takeaways\nThe primary takeaway for pitchers is simply a reinforcement of what we already learned about batters. The better a prospect, the better their chances at more success in the major leagues and improving upon their initial performance.\nIn particular for pitchers, top 25 prospects reign supreme. Top 25 pitching prospects were the most likely of any prospect group for both batters and pitchers to have an Elite or Great wOBA/wOBA Against grade after their first 150 plate appearances or 215 batters faced (26% compared to the next closest group at 14%—top 25 hitting prospects). So essentially one in four top 25 pitching prospects become aces as measured by wOBA Against."

Even a smaller percentage of unranked prospects with good career outcomes could indicate a number that is close to the corresponding number of a higher percentage of ranked prospects.\nSince as dynasty managers we are interested in getting the best young players on our teams, it’s helpful to know how big the respective pools of players are from which we can draw."

This is about ten batters each year on average. Seven of those ten were batters who were top 100 prospects. Three of them were unranked prospects."

    "text": "6.5 Number of Pitchers\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of pitchers is very similar to the distribution of batters. A notable difference is that no pitchers fell into the Awful wOBA Against grade and only one was Poor. Since position players can contribute in other ways beyond batting, they are able to perform poorly as a batter and remain in the league. Pitchers who are bad at pitching are bad at everything since pitching is all they do.\nLet’s do a little more napkin math! 84 pitchers had a career wOBA Against grade of Good or better, which translates to about four entering the player pool each year over the time period of focus. Two thirds of those pitchers were ranked prospects, one third unranked. So every three years, about twelve good pitchers would emerge—eight were ranked prospects, four were unranked."

Pitching prospects ranked 26 - 100 are more in a glob together, but pitching prospects ranked 26 - 50 are more likely to be average-ish than bad compared to pitching prospects ranked 51 - 100. Unranked prospects are clearly the last horse in this race."

I mentioned at the beginning that we’d return to him.\nIf you read his post, you will see that he compared the wOBA for a player in one season to their wOBA in the next season for the 2020 to 2023 seasons and calculated an R value of .5 and R2 value of .24. Coupled with Klaassen’s research, this helps reinforce that the power of a player’s past/current wOBA to explain future wOBA—for all batters, not just rookies—has limits.\nTango recommends two other statistics, Expected wOBA and, most of all, Predictive wOBA, that he shows do better in explaining a player’s future wOBA than actual wOBA.\n\n“As we know, Actual Outcomes are filled with vagaries of the fielders and the park and the ball and on and on. This is why we prefer Expected wOBA over Actual wOBA. Expected wOBA is focused on those launch characteristics most in control of the batter (launch angle and speed)…”\n\nEssentially, Expected and Predictive wOBA focus on the contact a batter made (how hard they hit the ball and at what angle), which helps eliminate more of the luck or unluckiness batters have when they get hits on bloops or make outs on scorching batted balls."

I’ve also included p-values (P) to show statistical significance, which are all .005 or less.

    "text": "7.5 Takeaways\nParticularly as dynasty fantasy managers, we’re best served using the best stats available to us. Even a slightly better predictor of future career success becomes an edge that compounds more and more over time. We should be mindful, though, that even the best stats to measure a player’s initial performance in the major leagues can only tell us so much about that player’s remaining career.\nBased on initial wOBA and wOBA Against, we can be more certain about batters’ future careers compared to pitchers. However, even after a batter has accumulated their first 600 plate appearances—a full season—the strength of the relationship between their initial wOBA and remaining career wOBA is moderate at best.\nWhile probably none of us are disciplined enough to hold a struggling batter for 900 plate appearances, we should be as patient as possible—especially with higher ranked prospects—and acknowledge that making decisions solely on the basis of initial performance, especially very small samples, is not supported by data.\nFor pitchers, even more patience is needed or a much better statistic/model."

    "text": "9.4 Data Transformation & Analysis\nNow for the exciting packages!\n\ndplyr package\nBy far and away, my favorite and most used package was dplyr, an extremely popular package in the world of data analysis. The name is meant to mean “d” for data and the “plyr” for plier, as in manipulating data with a tool like a plier. Even in the code above, mutate is a function from the dplyr package.\nIn a large sense, I took data out of the play-by-play dataset and moved it into a flat summary table with one row containing statistics and other relevant data for each player. dplyr made this possible.\nOne of my most crucial steps was to convert the wOBA value for every plate appearance for every batter and pitcher into a “rolling wOBA” or “rolling wOBA Against” data column. This took the cumulative wOBA or wOBA Against for a player up to that specific plate appearance (or batter faced) in their career. It enabled me to determine what a batter’s wOBA was at 150 plate appearances or a pitcher’s wOBA Against at 860 batters faced as an example. The code below uses dplyr functions that I used over and over—group_by, filter, mutate, relocate, ungroup—and also some base R functions—cumsum and seq_along. ungroup is still a bit confusing to me!\n\n# calculate rolling wOBA for batters\nbat_wOBA_log_debut_1990_on &lt;- career_wOBA_log_w_biodates %&gt;%\n  group_by(BAT_ID) %&gt;%\n  filter(BAT_DEBUT &gt; \"1990-04-08\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(ROLLING_WOBA_BAT = cumsum(EVENT_WOBA) / seq_along(EVENT_WOBA)) %&gt;%\n  relocate(ROLLING_WOBA_BAT, .after = CAREER_PA_WOBA_NUM) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nMy understanding is that dplyr is very similar to SQL (structured query language). It enables you to do SQL-like queries like this one which combed through the 71,080 baseball games in the dataset to find which ones ended in back-to-back home runs. This was probably the most fun code I wrote!\n\n# find the number of games ending in back-to-back home runs\nback_to_back_home_run_game_endings &lt;- game_data %&gt;% \n1  select(row_idx, GAME_ID, PARK, DATE, HOME_TEAM_ID, AWAY_TEAM_ID, INNING,\n2         BAT_NAME, PIT_NAME, EVENT_TX, HIT_VAL, EVENT_RUNS, PA_IND) %&gt;%\n3  arrange(ymd(DATE), row_idx) %&gt;%\n4  filter(PA_IND = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  group_by(GAME_ID) %&gt;%\n5  slice_tail(n = 2) %&gt;%\n6  filter(HIT_VAL == 4) %&gt;%\n  group_by(GAME_ID) %&gt;% \n7  add_count(GAME_ID) %&gt;%\n8  filter(n != 1) %&gt;%\n  arrange(ymd(DATE), row_idx)\n\n\n1\n\nPick only these columns from the dataset.\n\n2\n\n%&gt;% is called the forward pipe operator, which essentially says, “Do this %&gt;% then do this.”\n\n3\n\nArrange sequentially by date and order of events within each game.\n\n4\n\nFilter out non-plate appearance events like stolen bases.\n\n5\n\nSelect only the last two plate appearances of each game.\n\n6\n\nFilter for only home runs (HR).\n\n7\n\nCount how many times the game ID appeared (once (one HR) or twice (bingo!)).\n\n8\n\nFilter for games with more than one HR in last two plate appearances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\njanitor package\nAs amazing as dplyr is, it’s not the best tool for every single task. This is something I learned the hard way when trying to create cross-tabulations to find the value for the combination of two variables (think pivot tables if you’re more familiar with Excel) using a combination of dplyr functions. I stumbled across the janitor package, which has a function that in one line of code will create a crosstab for you—taybl. janitor also has a number of data cleaning functions, hence the name.\nThe package also has the ability to enhance crosstabs by calculating totals and percentages within rows or columns. If you look back at my tables, this code becomes very evident. The two commas in the adorn_percentages function below might make no sense to you. They still don’t make much sense to me and trigger a warning ⚠️ triangle in RStudio. It is telling janitor to skip unused arguments in the function. The Elite:DNQ is indicating to only calculate percentages for the Elite column through the DNQ column, not a “Total” column at the end, which I wanted to preserve with the numeric count.\n\n# create crosstabs for batters in a list, 150 PA, by prospect rank\nbatter_woba_grade_crosstabs_150_list &lt;- all_batter_career_data_by_ID %&gt;% \n  filter(BAT_DEBUT &lt; \"2011-01-01\") %&gt;% \n  tabyl(FIRST_150_WOBA_GRADE, POST_150_WOBA_GRADE, PROSPECT_RANK_GROUP) %&gt;% \n  adorn_totals(c(\"row\", \"col\")) %&gt;% \n  adorn_percentages(\"row\",,Elite:DNQ)"

We have the ability to tell him five things.\nOf course, we could tell Ralph to scoop up players like Frank Thomas, Pedro Martinez, Albert Pujols, etc., over the coming years, but this would only net him five superstars, which may not even be enough to ever win his league.\nFar better to teach a man to fish…\nIf we could only share five important findings from this project, what would we tell him?"

    "section": "8.3 Don’t Invest in Unranked Prospects",
    "text": "8.3 Don’t Invest in Unranked Prospects\nThis piece of advice is sure to be controversial and certainly deserves some qualifiers.\nThe first is that if I had more space in the heading, I may have framed it as, “Don’t invest in unranked prospects who have little to no potential to become ranked prospects.”\nThe second is that this is highly dependent on league settings. Ralph tells us that he is playing in a shallow 12 team league, so this is much more applicable. In deep leagues, unranked prospects should be valued more given that many more players are rostered.\nThe third is that there is a distinction between prospects who are just outside the top 100 rankings and prospects who miraculously make it to the major leagues. To lop them all together is not wise.\nOdds are not in unranked prospects favor. The percentage of unranked prospects who become above average major league players is about 5%. 59% of unranked batting prospects who debuted do not even reach 600 career plate appearances. 67% of unranked pitching prospects who debuted do not reach 860 career batters faced, equivalent to roughly 200 innings pitched.\nFurthermore, the number of unranked prospects that become major league players who get picked in the first couple of rounds of fantasy drafts on a regular basis is almost zero.\nIn light of this, routinely using up minor league spots for players who will likely at best be above average contributors is probably not a great strategy. Usually managers do this most with unranked prospects who are close to debuting or recently debuted.\nAn alternative strategy is to pursue younger prospects with the potential to become top 100 prospects, although this comes with its own diminished success rates. I do not have any analysis to prove that this is a better strategy."

As they accumulate more plate appearances and innings pitched over their first full season in the major leagues, this relationship strengthens but does not become strong, especially not for pitchers.\nAt 600 plate appearances for batters, Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R) is .5 and R2 is .25. At best, a full rookie season only moderately correlates with and predicts future career wOBA for batters.\nAt 860 batters faced—about 200 innings pitched—Pearson’s correlation coefficient is .25 and R2 is .06. At best, a full rookie season weakly correlates with and predicts almost nothing about future career wOBA Against for pitchers."

    "text": "8.6 Respect Greatness\nBatters who post a career wOBA of .370 or higher and pitchers who post a career wOBA Against of .309 or lower are extremely rare. On average, about two batters and two pitchers with these career wOBA/wOBA Against marks emerge each year.\nThese marks are not perfect in capturing “great” players in real life and even less so for fantasy. They also include a small number of active players whose final career wOBA/wOBA Against is subject to fluctuate, but these marks provide a relative idea of the rarity of “great” players.\nIn dynasty leagues, managers are apt to rebuild and retool for the future when they feel that their team in its current state is not good enough to compete for a championship. Trading away talented major league players to contending teams for top prospects or very young major league players is often the strategy that goes along with this.\nTo trade a great player away in an effort to rebuild, especially when that great player is still in their prime, is an action that should be rarely and gravely taken.\nOf prospects who debut, the percentage that put up a “great” career wOBA or wOBA Against are:\n\nA little less than 15% of top 50 batting prospects\nAbout 1 to 2% of batting prospects ranked 51 to 100\nAbout 25% of top 25 pitching prospects\nA little less than 10% of pitching prospects ranked 26 to 100\n\nIf you are simply trying to net a future “great” player in return, your chances are not high, especially if you are not getting many prospects back in the deal. This is why so many dynasty fantasy analysts advocate getting some young established major league talent in deals like this as opposed to only prospects.\nClearly, this is an oversimplification. The calculus for determining trade value is complex and player/league-dependent. However, this general concept emphasizes how serious a matter it is to trade away a great player.\nOn the other hand, trying to obtain a great player through a trade for top prospects may be worth pursuing. You’re likely to get burned some, for even great players are subject to aging curves and becoming shells of their former glory. Yet the adage resounds: “Prospects get churned, heroes get remembered, but legends never die.”"

Aggregated stats for rookie seasons won’t suffice due to the differing number of plate appearances and batters faced among players.\nI mentioned earlier that we will focus on players who debuted from 1990 through 2010 as our sample. The stats span from 1990 through 2020. You might find this sample selection a bit random, and to a certain extent you are right.\nThe primary reason I selected this sample was due to an available dataset that mostly met all the criteria I had:\n\nPlay-by-play data\nLarge enough sample size\nIn the modern era\nPre-constructed, easily accessible, mostly ready to go for analysis\n\nIf you skip ahead to my Project Process and Project Reflections, you’ll see that much of what I’m doing here is a first for me.\n\nHigh quality from a trusted researcher and institution\n\nThe underlying data comes from Retrosheet. The dataset owner, Ryan Brill, enhanced the Retrosheet data to be more useful for his research purposes like adding wOBA values for each play/event, which proved to be the linchpin for my analysis. I commend both of them to you for the fantastic work they do and acknowledge that my project exists in large part because of their labor."

    "section": "8.3 Limit Exposure to Unranked Prospects",
    "text": "8.3 Limit Exposure to Unranked Prospects\nThis piece of advice is likely to be controversial and requires some qualifiers.\nThe first is that this is highly dependent on league settings. Ralph tells us that he is playing in a shallow 12 team league, so this is much more applicable. In deeper leagues, unranked prospects should be valued more given that many more players are rostered.\nThe second is that there is a distinction between prospects who are just outside the top 100 rankings and prospects who miraculously make it to the major leagues. To lop them all together is not wise. Related, good batting prospects may be ranked lower based on defensive limitations.\nThe data for our years of focus show that the odds are not in unranked prospects favor. The percentage of unranked prospects who become above average major league players in wOBA/wOBA Against is about 5%. 59% of unranked batting prospects who debuted do not even reach 600 career plate appearances. 67% of unranked pitching prospects who debuted do not reach 860 career batters faced, equivalent to roughly 200 innings pitched.\nFurthermore, the number of unranked prospects that become major league players who get picked in the first few rounds of fantasy drafts on a regular basis is almost zero.\nIn light of this, routinely using up minor league spots for players who will rarely be above average contributors at best is probably not a great strategy. Typically, managers are more prone to do this with unranked prospects who are close to debuting or recently debuted.\nAn alternative strategy is to pursue younger prospects with the potential to become top 100 prospects, although this comes with its own diminished success rates. I do not have any analysis to prove that this is a better strategy.\nAll in all, it’s best to limit exposure to unranked prospects when possible. They are the worst investment."

    "text": "8.6 Respect Greatness\nBatters who post a career wOBA of .370 or higher and pitchers who post a career wOBA Against of .309 or lower are extremely rare. On average, about two batters and two pitchers with these career wOBA/wOBA Against marks emerge each year. These marks are not perfect in capturing “great” players in real life or fantasy and they also include a small number of active players whose final career wOBA/wOBA Against is subject to fluctuate, but these numbers provide a relative idea of the rarity of “great” players.\nIn dynasty leagues, managers are apt to rebuild and retool for the future when they feel that their team in its current state is not good enough to compete for a championship. Trading away talented major league players to contending teams for top prospects or very young major league players is often the strategy that goes along with this.\nTo trade a great player away in an effort to rebuild, especially when that great player still has at least multiple years of greatness left, is an action that should be rarely and gravely taken.\nOf prospects who debut, this percentage put up a “great” career wOBA or wOBA Against:\n\nA little less than 15% of top 50 batting prospects\nAbout 1 to 2% of batting prospects ranked 51 to 100\nAbout 25% of top 25 pitching prospects\nA little less than 10% of pitching prospects ranked 26 to 100\n\nIf you are simply trying to net a future “great” player in return, your chances are not high, especially if you are not getting many prospects back in return. This is why so many dynasty fantasy analysts advocate getting some young established major league talent in deals like this as opposed to only prospects.\nObviously, this is an oversimplification. The calculus for determining trade value is complex and player/league-dependent. However, this general concept emphasizes how serious a matter it is to trade away a great player.\nOn the other hand, trying to obtain a great player through a trade for top prospects may be worth pursuing. You’re likely to get burned some, for even great players are subject to aging curves and becoming shells of their former glory. Yet the adage resounds: “Prospects get churned, heroes get remembered, but legends never die.”"
